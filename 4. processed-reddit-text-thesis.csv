*Every* industry needs to be dismantled. *Now*. *Yesterday*.

That's horrifying for anyone who believes there is no greater measure of a country's health than its GDP. 

Renewables aren't ready to carry the *monstrous* weight of the consumer society we've built. Not on an international scale. Not even just in the US or Europe.

So in order to support *essential* functions-- food, safety, water-- with *just* renewables, everyone needs to cut back on *everything* nonessential.

What's nonessential?

The entire fashion industry. The entire beauty industry. The entire landscaping industry. The vast majority of the travel industry. The toy industry. Much of the residential construction industry. 99% of the packaged goods industry (how many brands of shampoo, soap, cereal, candy, soda pop, snack chips, frozen meals, cake mix, etc. do we really *need*). The meat industry. The dairy industry. The party supply industry. Much of the electronics industry. The HGTV-granite-counter-top home remodeling industry. The jewelry industry. Pretty much any store at a mall.

And last, **but certainly not least**, the military industrial complex.

We have ten years. This is no exaggeration. In order for human civilization to exist sustainably with the food, water, shelter to support everyone-- using only renewables-- all this other shit that didn't exist 150 years ago has got to disappear.

Maybe permanently.

Oh, and we need a 4-day (or even 3-day) work week, so everyone can have a job, but without all the traffic jams and electricity being burned up. Shit needs to be closed down and people stay home and play board games more often. So there's that, too.

So yeah, ""adults"" are frightened. Heads of state who have any brains are frightened. Billionaires who can see ten years ahead are frightened.

The ones who only care about their own lifetimes are fighting the change that needs to happen. The ones who fear the societal unrest the change will bring are fighting change. The ones who can't conceptualize a world without a growing GDP are fighting tooth and nail against the change.

And the super terrified ones? The ones who care about their grandkids and understand what's on deck if they don't admit the party is over and it's time for the hangover? Those heads of state, billionaires, and leaders are trying to make the change without capsizing the boat.

406,127,"I'd like to add boycott coffee from Brazil and -let your roaster/barista- know it. You can seriously make a huge impact beyond your wildest dreams and do so CONVENIENTLY and with little or no discernible change in your habits. Remember though, you need to get your message and support to the producers.

Brazil produces nearly 60MM bags of coffee annually, which is around 40% of all the coffee produced in the world. This includes varieties of Arabica and Robusta, high end and low end, and everything in-between. Though single origin, small estate coffees from Brazil are there, they are not all the rage in the specialty market. Instead, coffees for specialty blends (like for your local roasters espresso blend for example) and commercial blends (think your Folgers and Tim Hortons) are the primary movers and shakers. There are exceptions, but we're talking 1-2% of the Brazilian coffee market is the top stuff. The rest is commercial or for blends.

The sway Brazil has over coffee is so drastic, that reports of bad or good weather can affect the entire futures markets for coffee sold on in NY (the ICE or C Future for Arabica) and in London (for Robusta prices). So who to look to?

Big Players

* JAB Holdings, Nestle (yeah...they won't give a shit will they), Starbucks, and Lavazza are the dominant forces who control a substantial chunk of the green coffee importing business. Call your MPS and demand some action here, as these big folks are only going to bend to policy changes, sanctions (we use them to punish rogue states, why not rogue environmental states?), etc.

Mid Level Players

* Green Coffee Sellers. They sell to roasters. In the US (for whom I can speak to) are Olam, Cafe Imports, Ally Coffee (mainly Brazils), InterAmerican, Atlas, and some other small folks. Our folks who roast their own might recognize both Mr. Green Bean and Sweet Marias. CALL THEM. Tell them you will not purchase Brazilian coffee and ask for substitutes.
* The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) and other trade organizations. The SCA includes many guilds like the Roaster's Guild, Barista's Guild of America, etc, and spans the globe. Contact them. Express outrage. If you are going to an SCA event or a World Barista Championship...SPEAK OUT!

Low-Level Players

* Your local coffee shop and roaster. Don't just avoid Brazilian coffee, ask what the single origin is and get it. Your mind will likely be blown by what espresso is available or that regional offering rather than the standard breakfast blend. Tell the barista/roaster/owner WHY you don't want Brazil. Encourage them to get involved.

Why could this be stupid easy and result in absolutely no inconvenience to you, the busy consumer? There is a crap ton of amazing and well-priced coffees out there that blow Brazilian coffee out of the water. El Salvador? Yep. Guatemala? Sure. Some really nice stuff coming out of Peru these days and Honduras? Damn right.

439,169,"I'm new here so please forgive my abrupt entrance into this thread but I have a lot of thoughts about ARK and ESG.
To start it depends on your metrics for ESG. Ark itself has Mrs Wood at the helm so win for their G but also recently took a huge position in Palantir who have admitted to their platform being used to kill people so knock on the S; they also have a position in Draft Kings- how do you feel about gambling and/or Dave Potnoy. From an E stand point their biggest win was their early bet on Tesla and they have other evehicles which help to wash their environmental standards.  
Which brings me to point two, using Tesla as the example. The companies they are investing in may have a good ESG standing but that is not WHY they invest. Also, while TSLA has a great E, his Technoking-ness is far from woke on the S & G elements (unsafe working conditions, forcing workers back to work where they contracted covid so he could hit is bonus,  his brother is a mainstay of the board,  etc.)
This is where it comes down to what you want from your acronym. If you simply want to avoid serious carbon assets then disruptive tech by its current nature does pretty well. (Which incidentally is how a lot of these ESG funds do so well,  high percentage allocation to tech like FB, Microsoft, Tesla, etc because of thier ""low carbon footprint"" you know, because they are tech stocks...) However if you are looking for a more well rounded ESG or companies/investment firms that are actively pursuing ESG initiatives to better humanity, bring equality to the board room,  have social justice initiatives,  name your series of factors then Ark is not for you.

A few things too note about this study ""71 % studdy"": link to report [https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1501833772](https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1501833772)

Are  100 companies responsible for 71 % of GHG emissions? They are if you  look at the cumulative emissions in the period 1988 - 2015. However, in  2015 the 224 most emitting companies where responsible for 72 % GHG  emissions. 100 or 224 companies, I guess that is not really the point.

What  type of companies are these? All are fossil fuel producers. So, they  are not really making your products, except most of the energy we use.  So, if you have a car, use electricity or buy ANYTHING, good luck  boycotting.

Are these companies  really doing the emissions? Well yes, about 10 % of it. The remaining 90  % is downstream emissions. So if Shell or BP drills up oil and someone  uses the oil in their car the emissions will be attributed to Shell, and  not the driver.

Is this 71 % of  ALL anthropogenic emissions? No, this excludes non-industrial sources,  mainly land-use, agriculture and forestry. I don't know exactly how this  is accounted, but this excludes about 25 % of GHG emissions. So the  gain from veganism is not in this number. So the real number might be  about 54 % of anthropogenic emissions, but again I don‚Äôt know how this  would be accounted. So, in summary 224 companies are directly  responsible for 5.4 % of anthropogenic emissions, or 54 % direct +  indirect.

I do not want to make  excuses for these companies, i just want people too to be informed. So,  if people reduce their energy consumption these companies will reduce  their emissions too.

So what can  you do about this list? Not sure. If you have lots of money to invest,  you can use your power. Many people have lots of money in their  retirement savings, I think this is where people have the most direct  power. Reducing your energy use will also work. But this list is best  utilised by investors.

If I have misunderstood anything, please let me know.

> Nearly two thirds of Brits say that climate change is their number one concern, ahead of saving for their future.

> An independent study, commissioned by Clim8 Invest, found that the majority of British people are investing their savings in portfolios funding oil and gas companies.

> &quot;When you consider that UK consumers&#039; top two concerns are climate change and saving for their future, it&#039;s clear that by having their savings and pensions with typical fund providers, they are potentially being hit by a double whammy,&quot; says Duncan Grierson, CEO & Founder of Clim8 Invest.

Carbon sequestration benefits aside, this amazing root system means that despite a multi-year drought, the native grasses are still growing and producing significant biomass. Without this grass I have no doubt that I would have to sell my flock.

As an aside, grazing increases the carbon sequestration of grasses via ""root pruning"" - as the grass is eaten, some of the roots die back as they cannot be supported by the smaller leaf area. This sounds like a bad thing, but that root tissue turns into buried humus and is stored in the deep soil. When the grass is rested and grows back, the root volume increases to its original size.

* I'm a random jack-ass on Reddit
* I live in oil-country Kansas

Here is what I found when googling the issue. From a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/climate/trump-methane-climate-change.html) on the subject:

> The E.P.A.‚Äôs new methane rule eliminates federal requirements that oil  and gas companies must install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from wells, pipelines and storage sites.   
>  
>E.P.A. officials say the new, weaker methane rule is needed to free the oil and gas industry from what they call crippling regulations at a moment when companies are suffering from plummeting prices and falling demand driven by a sharp global economic slowdown. The weakening of the rule, however, **has been in the works for more than a year.** 

Large oil companies don't want the EPA to roll this back. They've spent a lot of money trumpeting how great they are for switching to natural gas. They also have the advantage of huge R&D departments and production at scale. These devices won't be as much of a burden on them as on smaller companies. I would be for the government producing these devices and passing them out for the same cost per well.

&#x200B;

>Several of the biggest oil and gas companies have called on the Trump  administration to tighten restrictions on methane, not loosen them. **Larger energy companies have invested millions of dollars to promote natural gas** as a cleaner option than coal in the nation‚Äôs power plants, because natural gas produces about half as much carbon dioxide when burned. **They fear that unrestricted leaks of methane could undermine that marketing message and hurt demand.**   
>

> The poll, shared exclusively with VICE News, found that 80% of Generation Z and Millennials believe &quot;Global warming is a major threat to human life on earth as we know it,&quot; according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors-Zogby Strategies National Youth Poll.

1130,1287,"And they are right. 


The IPCC is too model dependent.  Some elements of the climate system are linear and can be well predicted. But there are many non-linear events ‚Äì tipping points where the system goes from one state to another. These can only be modeled poorly.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, there is a wide gap between the real‚Äêworld climate action and what is required for stabilizing the climate at safe levels.‚Äù

Worrying signs of permafrost and how some scenarios talk of a carbon bomb potentially. If such a thing were to happen, 4C would be the least of our worries.  Arctic permafrost, a ‚Äúsleeping giant‚Äù of greenhouse gases, is melting faster than expected and could release 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide.  As the ground warms, the microbes in the soil wake up and start belching greenhouse gases. Estimates vary, but the report says 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide lurk beneath the Earth‚Äôs permafrost. That‚Äôs more than 40 times as much CO2 as humans released into the atmosphere last year, and double the amount of the gas in the atmosphere today.  37.1 billion metric tons in 2018.

McKinsley: India, by 2030 under an RCP 8.5 scenario, between 160 million and 200 million people could live in regions with a 5 percent average annual probability of experiencing a heat wave that exceeds the survivability threshold for a healthy human being 35¬∫C WET BULB.  10% of households had AC in 2018  By 2050, 0.7B to 1.2B people living in areas with a 14% annual likelihood of lethal heatwaves.

Blue-Ocean State (zero Arctic sea ice) in summer would heat the overall planet 0.71 W/m2 with expected cloud invariance (or 2.24 W/m2 with clear skies, or 0.37 W/m2 if overcast). This equals 1 trillion tons of CO2 or 25 years of warming.

Australia‚Äôs fires 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, more than the total combined annual emissions of the 116 lowest-emitting countries, and nine times the amount produced during California‚Äôs record-setting 2018 fire season. It also adds up to about three-quarters of Australia‚Äôs otherwise flattening greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019.

I'm going to make up a list of easy-to-do things and hard-to-do things for what we as individuals can change in our lifestyle to help:

For the record, my wife is an Ecologist (like Attenborough, just not famous lol) and we are both changing our priorities in every facet to make change. Some of these are expensive to do, some of them are easy to do no matter what your income is.


*Easy stuff:*


**Turn off your outdoor house lights at night.** Google 'Dark Sky movement' to understand why. Basically a lot of insects and life depend on their natural circadian rhythm. Let's stop messing around with that.

**If you have a cat as a pet, keep it indoors.** Cats are an invasive species and hunt down whatever they can get...especially song birds. There's a lot of sing birds that have declining numbers and cats contribute to this. Keep your cats inside.

**Don't purchase useless products.** 
Think of that show with Marie Kondo and purchase/keep stuff that you give some real thought about; if you deduce that product as improving your life, then great! If not, don't bother. Buy used stuff where possible.

**Inform your local municipalities to adopt new by-laws.** 
Propose new regulations/bylaws for tree cutting. Inform your municipalities to bring in cat control bylaws similar to existing dog control bylaws.

**Recommend your state or provincial government of new regulation.**
Propose to regulate and ban the selling of invasive and non-native vegetation at nurseries and landscape companies. Propose the banning of pesticides. Propose tax credits to home-owners and farmers to plant native plants/trees.

**Tell your non-right leaning friends and family to watch the documentary.**
Do not waste your time and effort trying to convince hard right-leaning family members. It's crushing to attempt it...I hate to generalize but red-necks and boomers are pretty stubborn and have lived comfortable lives. They don't want to change that. Educate people who are already more progressive or even centrist. They are usually more open-minded and intelligent.


*Medium Level stuff:*


**Minimize eating meat.** 
You don't have to stop eating meat, but try eating meat once a week or so...make the change gradually and its hardly noticeable.

**Buy food from local markets and buy organic where possible.** 
We need to stop supporting pesticide based agriculture.

**Do your research on native plant species in your area and plant them on your property**
Do your research on identifying invasive species and remove them when you see them. Plant native (to your area) plant species on your property instead.


*Difficult/Costly stuff:*


**Get rid of the gas powered utilities in your house:**

* Replace your gas stove with induction or electric (induction is best, but expensive). 
* Replace your gas furnace with electric air handler plus replace your A/C with a heat pump. Heat Pump + Air handler is a very efficient combination. Slightly more costly up-front.
* Replace your gas dryer with an electric dryer. We actually hang our clothes in our basement over the winter. We do not have a dryer at all.


**Replace your aging or high mileage car with an electric car** 
This should be your main savings priority even above the house stuff - petroleum based energy is worse than natural gas.

**Replace your shingles with solar shingles or add panels**
Tesla's solar shingles still haven't yet ramped up to full production but it will probably happen in the next few years.

**Consider having less or no kids** 
I put this one here as some people find this a touchy subject. Was an easy decision for us though.

**Donate money to local, state, provincial charities that support the environment and conservation of natural areas.** 
We donate to a Provincial nature charity and National charity that actually does lobbying too, which is awesome. We also donate to progressive political parties and Land Trusts (Land Trusts are usually run by environmental experts/hobbyists and they actively purchase existing natural land or farmland and re-naturalize it. Land Trusts are amazing and I get teary-eyed just thinking about how awesome our local one is).

**Minimize air travel.**
I put this here as some people find big vacations as a mandatory lifestyle choice. It is a choice after all, so choose to do less international travel (COVID making this easy). Travel by train or car to places within your own country that you would love to visit. For now try to stay home, due to COVID though! Also, minimizing air travel will save you quite a bit of money that you can put towards electrifying your house or purchasing an electric car.",I ve notice people get panic mode know start way improve life I m go make list easytodo thing hardtodo thing individual change lifestyle help record wife ecologist like attenborough famous lol change priority every facet make change expensive do easy matter income be easy stuff turn outdoor house light night google dark sky movement understand why basically lot insect life depend natural circadian rhythm let stop mess around that if cat pet keep indoor cat invasive specie hunt whatever getespecially song bird there s lot sing bird decline number cat contribute this keep cat inside do nt purchase useless product think show marie kondo purchasekeep stuff give real thought about deduce product improve life great not bother buy use stuff possible inform local municipality adopt new bylaw propose new regulationsbylaw tree cut inform municipality bring cat control bylaw similar exist dog control bylaw recommend state provincial government new regulation propose regulate ban sell invasive nonnative vegetation nursery landscape company propose ban pesticide propose tax credit homeowner farmer plant native plantstree tell nonright lean friend family watch documentary waste time effort try convince hard rightleane family member crush attempt iti hate generalize redneck boomer pretty stubborn live comfortable life want change that educate people already progressive even centrist usually openminde intelligent medium level stuff minimize eat meat stop eat meat try eat meat week somake change gradually hardly noticeable buy food local market buy organic possible need stop support pesticide base agriculture do research native plant specie area plant property research identify invasive specie remove see they plant native to area plant species property instead difficultcostly stuff get rid gas power utility house replace gas stove induction electric induction well expensive replace gas furnace electric air handler plus replace ac heat pump heat pump air handler efficient combination slightly costly upfront replace gas dryer electric dryer actually hang clothe basement winter dryer all replace age high mileage car electric car main saving priority even house stuff petroleum base energy bad natural gas replace shingle solar shingle add panel tesla solar shingle still yet ramp full production probably happen next year consider less kid put one people find touchy subject easy decision we though donate money local state provincial charity support environment conservation natural area donate provincial nature charity national charity actually lobby too awesome also donate progressive political party land trust land trust usually run environmental expertshobbyist actively purchase exist natural land farmland renaturalize it land trust amazing get tearyeyed think awesome local one be minimize air travel put people find big vacation mandatory lifestyle choice choice all choose less international travel covid make easy travel train car place within country would love visit try stay home due covid though also minimize air travel save quite bit money put towards electrify house purchase electric car,465,0.35294117647058826,0.07311827956989247,2020-10-08 13:00:20,1,esg-bullish

In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels in the first place.

> Norway plans to hit oil and gas companies with an increase in carbon taxes to the end of the decade as the major producer nation unveiled a new climate plan aimed at tackling its carbon dioxide emissions.

> At a press conference on Friday, Norway&#039;s Prime Minister Erna Solberg presented the government&#039;s climate ambitions to 2030, arguing that the CO2 tax is the most important means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production, which represents about a quarter of the country&#039;s total CO2 emissions.

> According to Solberg, Norway is not responsible for emissions resulting from the use of oil and gas exported from Norway - so-called Scope 3 emissions.

1315,1656,"Tell it to the grocery stores.

I hate how everything we do to help the natural world always has negative real world economic consequences.

Reduce fishing... put fishermen out of work.

Reduce selling fish... put fish sellers out of work. (Not to mention impacting fishing gear makers, boat sellers, dock workers, harbormasters, shipping companies, etc etc... every industry has a whole chain of economic activity connecting to it to make it possible.)

Cut back/stop eating meat... put cattle ranchers, feed suppliers, feed growing farmers, cowhands, inspectors, etc etc out of work

We have to start looking at these issues not just as single issues. If we can't find creative and economically viable ways to mitigate those negative economic consequences we're going to keep having an almost insurmountable battle.

For example... we could use UBI and training dollars.

We want to cut back on overfishing. Great. So the government should give people impacted a period of economic assistance and subsidized training options to help them transition to some other way of supporting themselves. No solution will be perfect... nothing ever is. There will still be economic fallout.

1412,1897,"
Common sense at last !!

More than 500 scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have sent a ‚ÄúEuropean Climate Declaration‚Äù to the Secretary-General of the United Nations asking for a long-overdue, high-level, open debate on climate change.
Just as 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.

‚ÄúClimate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,‚Äù the declaration states. ‚ÄúScientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.‚Äù

The scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.
‚ÄúThere is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,‚Äù they declared. ‚ÄúHowever, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.‚Äù
The signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.

‚ÄúThere is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,‚Äù they note. ‚ÄúWe strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world,‚Äù they state.
In particular, the scientists criticize the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is currently founded as ‚Äúunfit for their purpose.‚Äù
‚ÄúTherefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models,‚Äù they propose. ‚ÄúCurrent climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,‚Äù they declare.",common sense last 500 scientist professional climate relate field send european climate declaration secretarygeneral united nation ask longoverdue highlevel open debate climate change 16yearold swedish climate activist greta thunberg address un climate action summit new york accuse world leader rob future scientist beg united nation keep hysteria obscure fact climate science less political climate policy scientific declaration state scientist openly address uncertainty exaggeration prediction global warming politician dispassionately count real benefit well imagine cost adaptation global warming real cost well imagine benefit mitigation scientist underscore importance rush enormously expensive climate action fully ascertain fact there statistical evidence global warming intensify hurricane flood drought suchlike natural disaster make frequent declare however co2mitigation measure damage costly instance wind turbine kill bird bat palmoil plantation destroy biodiversity rainforest signatorie declaration also insist public policy must respect scientific economic reality reflect fashionable frenzy day there climate emergency therefore cause panic alarm note we strongly oppose harmful unrealistic netzero co2 policy propose 2050 if well approach emerge certainly will ample time reflect adapt aim international policy provide reliable affordable energy time throughout world state particular scientist criticize generalcirculation model climate international policy currently found unfit purpose therefore cruel well imprudent advocate squander trillion basis result immature model propose current climate policy pointlessly grievously undermine economic system put life risk country deny access affordable continuous electrical power we urge follow climate policy base sound science realistic economic genuine concern harm costly unnecessary attempt mitigation declare,239,-0.4594594594594595,0.15481171548117154,2019-10-18 21:29:49,-1,esg-bearish

Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own. And [**a carbon tax is expected to spur innovation**](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190827111120.htm).

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level). 

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (it [saves lives at home](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x)) and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses, because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) in the first place. We [won‚Äôt wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [**pricing carbon is necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ¬∫C target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support. But [we can't keep hoping others will solve this problem for us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility). We need to take the necessary steps to make this dream a reality:

¬ß The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

1511,2146,"Currently working on a university environmental class here that covers precisely this topic and I‚Äôm noticing there are a few concepts being overlooked that were mentioned very briefly by the 2nd scientist who commented on the research of the 1st scientist:

1) live stock isn‚Äôt ALL bad: 
Why? agricultural practices can benefit from ROTATIONAL GRAZING of livestock; basically mimicking how species would have grazed in the wild will add good organic matter (aka poop) back into the soil to bring up the soil fertility. Good soil fertility = better agriculture outcomes= better carbon sink.


2) PROBLEMS IF AGRICULTURE WAS THE ONLY FOOD SOURCE USED (with its current mainstream practices):

A) MONOCROPPING

Definition: the planting of only one type of crop

Reasons against: 
-reduces soil fertility 
- leads to run off that pollutes our waters
- leads to erosion 
- requires pesticide use

Solution: 
- polycropping
- inter/alley cropping
- crop rotation 


B) PESTICIDE USE

Reasons against:
- only approx. 2% of pesticides make it on to the desired target
- the other 98% becomes airborne pollutants or run off
- pests develop resistance easily due to short life spans and then require larger doses or a whole new type of pesticide further polluting soils
- unintended side effect: kills potential pest predators too

Solution: use of plants that fend of pests

C) WATER MANAGEMENT 
Note: With only having 2.5% of the worlds water be fresh water and only 0.5 % be accessible (aka not tied up in glaciers/ permafrost)we need to treat ol‚Äô blue right.

Problem: 
- ground water/aquifer depletion 
- pollution from fertilizer and pesticide run off leading to eutrophication 
- desalination is not as environmentally friendly as was hoped (energy wise and the addition of salt back into the ocean‚Äî> changes salinity‚Äî> changes animals habitats)

Solution:
- retention ponds
- terracing
- trees

D) TILLING (turning over the soil)
Note: when I learned this it was a big surprise to me...

Problem:
- leads to leeching ( putting the nutrients into soil horizons inaccessible to plants)
- soil crusting that leads nutrient run off

Solution:
-  No till farming ( e.g shallow cultivation)
- use of ‚Äúgreen litter‚Äù 



TAKE AWAY:  REDUCING CONSUMPTION= GOOD. ENTIRELY REMOVING = DEBATABLE .
(Atm moderation is key and pushing for cleaner practices on ALL fronts is necessary for sustainability)



P.S not so fun fact: the last time our supply met our demand was in 1970. Yikes.

P.p.S some things my prof said we can do on an individual level to help our ecological footprint that aren‚Äôt so obvious:

- use shampoos/detergent products that don‚Äôt contain phosphorus 

- when planting grass use native species for your region so not as much water is needed to maintain 

- advocate for ‚Äúselective cutting‚Äù in leiu of clear cutting practices 

- advocate for minimum living standards/education‚Äî> long story short: this helps with population control  

- the 3 Rs of water management ( reduce, repair, retrofit)

1555,2256,"This is for you city dwellers who aren't self reliant but instead subscribe to having industry somehow saves you?? This also has huge negative impacts not accounted for.. like actually building soils ability to hold moisture and returning carbon to the ground instead of leaching it at every turn!! Rotational crop production in large scale agriculture is a joke to the health of the soils demise.  Annual crops can never build soils.. perennials that stay in place do but not when you rip up the ground every year and replant!! 

That's why non of us meat eaters listen to your Vegan propaganda. Skewed numbers in your favor without discussing the complexity of actually growing real food. Also industrial meat production and reliance on national slaughter houses.. all part of those numbers you think are so righteous.  I don't want to eat national slaughter house meats but can't eat 90% of what vegans think is food also so I try to be very selective in my consumption... Also spent years figuring out my vegetable problems while growing vegetables and working on many farms. So I know how best to grow food of all kinds but also how they influenced my health.. even tomatoes are days of pain.. 
 Now that I don't eat those things and eat mostly red meat and fat my health has greatly improved... I am not a sick animal anymore and don't eat sick animals which are those raised in industry!! 

Keep your industrial agriculture reliance and petrochemical fertilizers and see how long you can really grow food before they tell you the soil is trash.  Only 8% of farms use real fertilizers and by that I mean manure!! It's a shame because a healthy ecosystem is a mix of things, just like a healthy gut.. it needs fungus and tons of microbes that are ruined with industry.

Happened over and over again here in the US.. long before the dust bowl the great western expansion was partly due to ruined agricultural lands than had nearly depleted the top soils in the east. 

If you really care about the environment than stop preaching and start learning!! Top soil depletion is a huge problem still.. river pollution from farms still raises the salinity of the rivers downstream over 30 fold.  Never mind the fact that these things could be mitigated by small changes in production like allowing for furloughed strips on the edges of fields or near runoff.. pretty sure that change alone would stop 70% of topsoil loss or something crazy like that but you're too focused on us meat eaters to worry about growing your food properly.",city dweller self reliant instead subscribe industry somehow save you also huge negative impact account for like actually build soil ability hold moisture return carbon ground instead leach every turn rotational crop production large scale agriculture joke health soil demise annual crop never build soil perennial stay place rip ground every year replant that s non we meat eater listen vegan propaganda skew number favor without discuss complexity actually grow real food also industrial meat production reliance national slaughter house part number think righteous want eat national slaughter house meat ca nt eat 90 vegan think food also try selective consumption also spend year figure vegetable problem grow vegetable work many farm know well grow food kind also influence health even tomato day pain eat thing eat mostly red meat fat health greatly improve sick animal anymore eat sick animal raise industry keep industrial agriculture reliance petrochemical fertilizer see long really grow food tell soil trash 8 farm use real fertilizer mean manure shame healthy ecosystem mix thing like healthy gut need fungus ton microbe ruin industry happen we long dust bowl great western expansion partly due ruin agricultural land nearly deplete top soil east really care environment stop preach start learn top soil depletion huge problem still river pollution farm still raise salinity river downstream 30 fold never mind fact thing could mitigate small change production like allow furloughed strip edge field near runoff pretty sure change alone would stop 70 topsoil loss something crazy like focus we meat eater worry grow food properly,255,-0.4444444444444444,0.07058823529411765,2021-04-25 16:09:53,-1,esg-bearish

1565,2281,"if we end industrial animal agriculture then we could destroy the earth at a substantially slower rate by destroying it with just industrial plant agriculture. 

we can still use pesticides and herbicides an synthetic fertilisers, we can still grow in vast monoculture fields, we can still till and rip the soil and ignore the soil food web, we can still fail to mulch and cover the soil, we can still use mass amounts of agricultural plastics, we can still destroy ecosystems to create industrial factory farms for cash crops, we can still poison the natural gene pool with artificial genetics, we can still mine away the topsoil that was built up by the plants and animals who lived wild and free before us, roaming the continent.

&#x200B;

man how great could we feel about ourselves as a species if we succeed in converting everyone into vegans, where we've destroyed the majority of all life on earth and then reduce our rate of destruction to a slow, painful crawl. Maybe we can even strive for the greatest heights of 0, of nothing, of net zero carbon, and after destroying almost all living things we can sustain life at that low and miserable state by reaching an equilibrium at this low point.

May we continue to blame cows for the problems of humanity. may we continue to blame omnivores for eating an omnivorous diet, may we continue our war on carbon, perhaps the most important element for life, as we ourselves destroy life. 

May we continue to misunderstand the role of animals in our ecosystems due to the data collected from our factory farming systems, our systems of death, and blame the cow, the pig, and the chicken for humanity's insanity. 

may we worship $cience and eat lab-grown meat and gmo soybeans as we attempt to sustain our sick and twisted way of life, grasping on to our addiction to comfort and disconnection, our addiction to the non-living, to the temporary ego boosts of buying something new, something that ""is good for the planet""

what if?

what if instead we humbled ourselves to nature, stopped believing ourselves to be so scientific and rational, and observed newly, like a child, to see what we might be missing? Then maybe we could stop striving for zero and strive to do something positive. What if instead of leaving no trace, we learned the proper role of animals in the ecosystem, respected our omnivorous biology, and we could leave a fantastic and positive trace? 

Like the beaver, who, in building a dam for themselves to live by, creates magnificent habitat for a thousand new species of fish, insect, plant, algae, bacteria? Who, just by building themselves a home, also contribute immensely to the strength, flow, and resilience of local hydrological cycles? Without even meaning to.

Or like the wolf, who, by roaming in a pack, hunting and playing, heal the rivers and the grasslands? Just by their play and dance, they make more room for new rodents and birds and bugs and twigs? 

What if the beaver left no trace? What if the wolves left no trace? How sad and pathetic and tragic would that be? What if the birds and bees and lizards and trees left no trace? What if that was their highest goal, how sad would that be?

And here, the human animal, the most capable and adaptable animal of them all, with capacity for thinking and speaking and grasping that surpasses all other animals, instead of making the world around them a fantastic diverse garden of life, thought the best they could do was to be small and leave no trace? How fucking pathetic would that be? If the human animal was so used to being a cancer for the last 1000 years, they forgot they could do anything good at all? And thought, hey lets just fuck it up less, that would be the best. 

When a plant bears children, it produces ten thousand seeds, and hopes one or two reach maturity. We can take that plant and help all its children reach vibrant and full growth! When a beaver makes a dam, the fish and frogs and plants are so happy. The beaver has only its teeth and its guts to cut down trees and figure out where to put them. We could watch and learn how the beaver does this and make dams much faster, much better, with metal tools to make the job easier, with friends to make it easier, and the fish and frogs and plants would be all the happier than they are with the beaver.

But we don't look at how the beaver makes a dam. we only care about ourselves, and we don't consider nature, and we make the worst dams, we make dams that destroy ecosystems. How does the beaver do it? We don't ever take the time to ask.

&#x200B;

What if like the wolf, who chase along the deer and rabbits, to give the grass some time to grow, to give the river plants time to recover, to absorb the manure and gain the fertility, instead of dissipating its good fertility toxically into the air? We could watch the movement of the wolf and deer, and learn how to mimic that dance. We could note how the wolf heals the rivers and grasslands, and learn to do the same or more. That would be real science. We could understand the ecosystem and help it do what it does. But we think we're so fucking scientific and smart, we ignore all that, observing nothing but our own diseased inventions, and collect data on our factory farms, and decide that animals are bad for the environment. And worse, we think we are smart for doing it.

&#x200B;

If we would only turn our intellect, our observation, our logic, in line with nature and her dancing web of life, we could make the greatest contributions, with the help of plants and with the help of animals, all working together for the greatest benefits to all living things. nah lets continue to ignore nature and the contributions of each species, and continue to separate ourselves further from it as we strive for zero.",end industrial animal agriculture could destroy earth substantially slow rate destroy industrial plant agriculture still use pesticide herbicide synthetic fertiliser still grow vast monoculture field still till rip soil ignore soil food web still fail mulch cover soil still use mass amount agricultural plastic still destroy ecosystem create industrial factory farm cash crop still poison natural gene pool artificial genetic still mine away topsoil build plant animal live wild free we roam continent x200b man great could feel specie succeed convert everyone vegan we ve destroy majority life earth reduce rate destruction slow painful crawl maybe even strive great height 0 nothing net zero carbon destroy almost live thing sustain life low miserable state reach equilibrium low point may continue blame cow problem humanity may continue blame omnivore eat omnivorous diet may continue war carbon perhaps important element life destroy life may continue misunderstand role animal ecosystem due datum collect factory farming system system death blame cow pig chicken humanitys insanity may worship cience eat labgrown meat gmo soybean attempt sustain sick twisted way life grasp addiction comfort disconnection addiction nonlive temporary ego boost buy something new something be good planet if instead humble nature stop believe scientific rational observe newly like child see might miss maybe could stop strive zero strive something positive instead leave trace learn proper role animal ecosystem respect omnivorous biology could leave fantastic positive trace like beaver who build dam live by create magnificent habitat thousand new specie fish insect plant algae bacteria who build home also contribute immensely strength flow resilience local hydrological cycle without even mean to like wolf who roam pack hunting play heal river grassland play dance make room new rodent bird bug twig beaver leave trace wolf leave trace sad pathetic tragic would be bird bee lizard tree leave trace high goal sad would be here human animal capable adaptable animal all capacity think speak grasping surpasse animal instead make world around fantastic diverse garden life think good could small leave trace fucking pathetic would be human animal use cancer last 1000 year forget could anything good all think hey lets fuck less would good plant bear child produce ten thousand seed hope one two reach maturity take plant help child reach vibrant full growth beaver make dam fish frog plant happy beaver tooth gut cut tree figure put they could watch learn beaver make dam much fast much well metal tool make job easy friend make easy fish frog plant would happy beaver look beaver make dam care ourselves consider nature make bad dam make dam destroy ecosystem beaver it ever take time ask x200b like wolf chase along deer rabbit give grass time grow give river plant time recover absorb manure gain fertility instead dissipate good fertility toxically air could watch movement wolf deer learn mimic dance could note wolf heal river grassland learn more would real science could understand ecosystem help do think be fucking scientific smart ignore that observe nothing diseased invention collect datum factory farm decide animal bad environment bad think smart it x200b would turn intellect observation logic line nature dancing web life could make great contribution help plant help animal work together great benefit live thing nah let continue ignore nature contribution specie continue separate strive zero,544,-0.0625,0.11764705882352941,2021-04-26 02:34:59,-1,esg-bearish

1627,2436,"The comments on this post seem to miss the fact that this tweet makes two arguments, one which is entirely reasonable and one that is plainly ridiculous.

If there was a global recession in the near future, this would very likely cause terrible suffering: people would lose their jobs, other people would have less income. The negative effects would almost certainly be borne disproportionately by the poorest. Environmentalists who advocate for ‚Äòdegrowth‚Äô often miss this reality.

But that‚Äôs not to say economic growth is inherently good. In a world where everyone has sufficient resources to live a good life, additional GDP growth will not necessarily make anyone any happier. Similarly, the positive effects of some types of growth are, in our current world, outweighed by the the negative effects (on health, the environment, human rights, etc).

Hence the emphasis on ‚Äòsustainable growth‚Äô by some organisations. Even this runs the risk of saying that economic growth is a worthwhile goal so long as it is sustainable (whatever exactly that means). 

Better to say:
1.  That our goal should be ensuring that everyone has what they need to live a good life, and then, to maximise overall happiness...
2. And that, in pursuit of this goal, economic growth is a currently necessary for much of the world‚Äôs population...
3. But we should also adopt policies to ensure that, for any economic growth that takes place, the benefits actually outweigh the costs.

1641,2471,"Absolutelly! There are several reasons why this is true. It is a really complex issue, but, as we must understand sustainability, there is no scenario in which we humans bet for a sustained economic growth while making life bearable for the most vulnerable majorities living in our planet.

There is no argue about this fact. And here I'll expose some of the reasons that sustain that statement. I'll try to be thorough:

In these days that we are living and those that will come, we'll have to make the less harmful decisions. As result of the decision that were made in the past and which can't be reversed, we are living in a system that is collapsing. And I highlight that they are not reversible as Climate Change is something that will happen even though we cut drastically our global GHE, and the same can be told about the ecosystemic destruction, the decrease of energy availability and a large etc of factors that define our times. Thinking otherwise is giving to the human being capacities which we don't possess.

And what are the less harmful decisions? It depends on how we face that question. Non-optimal options that lie ahead are multiple and in different fields, but i'll focus on one related to this post. The ones that are being contemplated are retaking the path of growth or starting policies based on degrowth of energy and material consumption. Which one is the less harmful? There is no doubt about any of those is sub-optimal.

In the scenario in which countries do their climate homework and choose drastic policies sustained in time of degrowth, enhancing local economy and the primary sector while keeping the actual structure of the laboral market, there would be a massive job destruction. Living in a society in which satisfying our necessitoes relies on money, which we can only obtain with jobs, this is obviously not an optimal solution. There are some measures that could soften the impact of this option, like reducing the workday and others related to wealth redistribution ([a pilar of sustainability as the founders of the concept itself stated in the early 70's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth)) - basic income, expropriation, actually distributed taxation -. But we should go even further giving people autonomy and changing the life conditions to make the basic necessities not dependent of the market.

In my opinion, in our highly unequal societies in which we live in we should struggle to put them in march. Most likely, it won't happen nor fast enough neither with the adequate extension. Opposing to them there are very powerful forces. Even though it is true that living more austere lifes and with an harmonic relationship with ecosystems lead to more plenty and happier lifes.

So, let's see what to expect from the other option: retaking the economic growth. This can be achieved throughout two major policy blocks: ¬†on the one hand, those based in a massive use of fossil fuels and the maximum exploitation of natural resources, the option _business as usual_ (BAU); and on the other hand, those involved in the denominated _Green New Deal_ (GND), which pivots on a massive deployment of renewable energies.

The BAU option is exemplified by the removal of the Environmental Law from Donald Trump, or the Chinese bet for Carbon. All accompanied by a huge amount of money creation which usually ends up in the most contaminating part of the economy. This will lead us to a planet 4-6 Celsius degrees over the actual climate stability, which would mean that major parts of our planet would be impracticable for human life.

Runaway Climate Change is our worst choice, it has already produced over 500k deaths, and it will get worse. Without going any further, it is producing the right conditions to pandemic proliferation. Its impacts increase exponentially as the temperature raises, and I think something that we have learned about the covid crisis that we are living is to understand the importance of the exponentially rising curves. We are already living in a time of resource depletion and an early complete disruption of certain ecosystems.

GND is not an option either, mainly due to two reasons. In the short term, it would increase the GHE, and in the mid term, the reduction won't be enough. The second reason is that there are not enough materials to carry it out. In addition, there are more arguments about their inability to maintain the current lifestyle and growth, such as the limited power and versatility of renewables. GND is a false optimal solution.

To all this we should add that, even with strong redistributive measures, both options, BAU and GND, involve high suffering of millions of people, because they are based on maintaining the social and territorial gap. It is one of the keys to the functioning of capitalism.

Thus, in all options, the popular classes are quite likely to suffer. Although in all of them this suffering will depend on the struggles we wage to achieve a greater or lesser redistribution of wealth, the suffering will be inherently unequal in all three ways. While in the option of degrowth what is on the table is the degree of economic hardship that many people endure, betting on growth what we risk, without exaggerating an iota, is life.

What do I think that our real options are?

To build a postcapitalist economy based on a de-commercialization and de-desalination of our lives. No minimally emancipatory change can be realized without confrontation with the capitalist classes.

Some of you will argue that this is something that it is not socially possible. However, this idea is losing strength after the Covid-19 pandemic. These days life has been prioritized, and we have realized what are the essential services to mantain a dignified life: food, health, waste management, care for dependent persons, etc. These essential services fit in with the triad of decreases-localization-primary economy. And all this has come about with a high level of social consensus. What seemed impossible, suddenly, in a few weeks, has become an assumed reality. 

However, economic and political powers are already striving to implement the same policies that led to this disaster based on environmental destruction and the extension of economic globalization. It‚Äôs like seeing someone who, just as he begins to recover a little bit from a heart attack, begins to plan on returning with redoubled strength to the way of life that led him to that situation.

Anyhow, We would be deceived if we thought that what we are living is a parenthesis, a punctual pause -more or less long and deep- in the normality. Nothing will be ever the same than before. The collapse of our system will produce other shocking situations. To cite one example among many, we are likely to experience increasingly long periods of supply of fossil fuels, which will lead to a cascade of socio-economic impacts, starting with the short-circuit of human transport and, Which is more relevant, goods. Something that may still seem distant is becoming more and more likely. Crude oil prices on the ground are leading to the bankruptcy of US fracking companies, but in general they are a problem of the sector, which sees its profitability diminishing. This results in the reduction in investments, which is already underway. The result is that the lower availability of crude oil is reinforced. In such a situation, a massive restriction of mobility can be understood as logical by the population and this restriction is not only personal, but also implies a commitment to more local production and consumption. Much more local than that. Again, something that is difficult to put forward today at the political level, but much less than before the pandemic, can be made feasible.

In the face of that fear, our responsibility is to convey hope, for only another emotion can help to overcome it. I say it‚Äôs a responsibility because I think we have to do it, even if it weakens us. If we who fight for a just, democratic and sustainable world do not do so, no one will realize it, and without hope there is no emancipatory process of change that can succeed. Other social sectors will use this fear to maintain their positions of power by fomenting confrontations among the popular classes.

I don‚Äôt mean a hope in magic solutions, or in the return to the previous normal. That‚Äôs impossible. I am referring to the hope that the collapse of this social and economic order may offer us opportunities to build societies where life is worth living. A hope centered on a lucid thought.

The emotional burden of making the least bad decisions is very heavy. In normal times, we can afford a way to be flaccid. Let us be carried away by collective and individual automatisms. In times like these we are living in, we have a vital and ethical obligation to grow in the challenges we face in our personal lives and in our political choices.",absolutelly several reason true

1717,2661,"My husband and I have been talking about doing this for years. Buying a large acreage, inviting people we like, incorporating a town. We wouldn't allow any chain type stores, and wouldn't tolerate any environmental negatives like littering. But, we're not communal living people, so our town wouldn't require any commitment to the community garden etc. That would be on a volunteer basis. 

I had a better idea, though (because my bestie is disabled) to create a self sustaining town for disabled people. Would need land, and a grant to build, but I wanted to build self sustaining homes on the land (earthship/cob), and disabled people would get to live in it for free. The homes would be built or modified specifically for their disability. It would belong to them, but cannot be 'sold', instead, if they move or die, it would go to someone else in need. The community would specifically cater to the younger disabled. My friend is 32 and in a bad way, so living with the elderly disabled is not something I'd want for her. Besides, there's 55+ communities, and I've never seen a 55- community. 

In that community, everyone would be required to do something for the community that is within their ability. There would be a giant community garden to provide fresh food to the residents year round, and a large water catchment system as well. Those who can cook would have 'jobs' in the community kitchen, which would deliver meals to those who cannot cook at home. Everyone would have some sort of job, depending. So a disabled tax accountant, for example, would help residents file their taxes, or maybe someone who makes jewelry could sell it and some of the proceeds would go to the community to hire outside help to fill in some gaps. I'd have liked to have tour days, where people from outside can come and tour the community- the gardens/ systems, maybe a spec sustainable home. We'd take donations of time, materials, or money. 

Ideally, we'd have a storefront in the community to sell our excess canned foods, or any art/crafts the residents make to the outside. There'd also be a community bus that goes into town for trips, or doctor appts. Any profits the community makes goes into an account and are used to maintain the community, or modify homes for new residents etc. The hope is that the grant money will only be necessary in the beginning, and then the community becomes self sufficient.

Should we stop those efforts? A meme author seems enlightened enough about our work to call them vain. Apparently discernment is unwarranted, since we're one of ""just about every tech company"", what we do is ""designing for the dump and creating ewaste"".  


Still, that's odd. I seem to recall from the history of computing that IT engineers, *when they try,* do manage to reduce computing infrastructure footprint by orders of magnitude. Likewise, I seem to recall that almost all of the IT footprint was concentrated on a few unessential activities (entertainment, advertisement, e-commerce, Bitcoin) by a very small number of companies, while essential communication and information-processing accounted for less than 1% of IT footprint. So you'd think this e-waste could be dramatically reduced without condemning ""just about every tech company"".

First focus on making sure that the present is taken care of with ongoing price fixing.

If they clean it themselves it‚Äôll be much cheaper for them, which is good because this will encourage ongoing practices more than a fine. 

The reason I think the system is broken is because true costs of things are not accounted for in pricing, and certain players have figured out how to cheat it. If we get rid of the cheats and make impacts affect money, then people and especially companies will naturally be more inclined, and even forced, to act better for the climate. It‚Äôs not a particularly rosy idea, but it is practical. Sustainability is the issue at hand, and it‚Äôs not sustainable to leave as little investment in controlling the climate as we have now.

2255,4006,"The challenge in this, like so many other realms, is Taylorism at work. As humans seek methods of economic optimization the reality of complexity is usually overlooked. Human societies have generally congregated around waterways (rivers, lakes, oceans) since the dawn of what are sometimes referred to as hydraulic civilizations. Fish have been a critical food source in many cultures for millennia. The difficulty that our modern systems create though is the ability to over-exploit these natural systems. Globally we have depleted wild fisheries to such an extent that we're causing extinctions which are further exasperated by things like anoxic dead zones, oil spills, micro-plastic, global warming, and the like. Most fishermen aren't trying to put themselves out of a job, but our industrial systems generally prioritize profits, and dismiss things like massive amounts of bycatch as externalities. This is coupled with a general disconnect of many people from their food, where they don't even fully realize that they're eating an animal, as often all they see is ""meat"" in a package or on a plate. Different companies and countries have varying degrees of safeguards and enforcement to try to make the system more sustainable but we still (globally) have a long way to go. Those willing (and able) to eliminate or minimize fish in their diets help to counterbalance and offset those who are unaware, unable, or unwilling and help to reduce demand. This helps to somewhat reduce the pressure on these aquatic ecosystems. Some positive steps toward truly sustainable and regenerative aquaculture could include better food labeling, international treaties and enforcement, innovations in tools and practices, and expanded education on the issues to name just a few. The point of this rant, however, is that when you treat a complex system like an optimization problem, you wind up with unintended consequences.",challenge this like many realm taylorism work human seek method economic optimization reality complexity usually overlook human society generally congregate around waterway river lake ocean since dawn sometimes refer hydraulic civilization fish critical food source many culture millennia difficulty modern system create though ability overexploit natural system globally deplete wild fishery extent be cause extinction exasperate thing like anoxic dead zone oil spill microplastic global warming like fisherman try put job industrial system generally prioritize profit dismiss thing like massive amount bycatch externality couple general disconnect many people food even fully realize they re eat animal often see meat package plate different company country vary degree safeguard enforcement try make system sustainable still globally long way go willing and able eliminate minimize fish diet help counterbalance offset unaware unable unwilling help reduce demand helps somewhat reduce pressure aquatic ecosystem positive step toward truly sustainable regenerative aquaculture could include well food label international treaty enforcement innovation tool practice expand education issue name few point rant however treat complex system like optimization problem wind unintended consequence,174,-0.3939393939393939,0.1896551724137931,2020-11-01 09:56:07,-1,esg-bearish

2380,4317,">Currently, we can plant a tree approximately every 45 searches, and we've planted 62 million trees in biodiversity hotspots around the world so far. Joining the AMA (live 1 pm ‚Äì 5 pm European time, August 9) is our CEO Christian, software dev Jason and community lead Trudie.

That is a great initiative and I have been using your search engine lately. I want to ask several questions to get a clear sense of how this is implemented, the reason being that if this is possible then many other organizations in various fields can adopt this approach. I am not saying all of the following questions demand explicit answers here in this thread only, even pointers to some resources or to some other threads are great and I will do the required reading ( will post further doubts if not satisfied ). If the answer to a question cannot be given due to some reasons, just mention that you are skipping it, I won't mind at all.
- Where is the money transported to exactly? I mean who are the people/organizations actually responsible for planting trees and doing the manual labour?
- How many mediators are there exactly from **gaining revenue from advertisements** to **trees being planted**? I mean how do you ensure the work is actually being done if so many people will be involved in the process?
- You say you plant trees in biodiversity hotspots, **how you actually select a hotspot to be refurnished with trees**? Which hotspots you have covered/covering as of now?
- What type of trees do you actually plant? Does it depend upon the hotspot?
- If your ad revenue mostly goes to plant trees then how do you sustain your needs? I mean how overall is this profitable if even at all?
- How many hotspots in different parts of the continent have you covered? I am from India, do you have any plan of choosing a hotspot here also?
- Is there some way I can publicise Ecosia which will benefit you, please suggest some measure on a small scale at least.
- Is Ecosia open-source of some sort so that people can contribute to its source code?
- We can easily compare the quality of the result of the searches, with the Big Guns such as **Google**, although your motive is wonderful, most people need some nice incentive other than just *morality* ( which I personally feel is wrong ), can you explain what are the upcoming developments by your technical team regarding the improvement of your search results ( some technical blog links will be great if they are available ). **I am not saying you can directly compete on their level**, just want to understand your pace, scope and vision of the development of your product.
- I suggest you should apply for several programs for developing sprint like GSoC, Outreachy etc if possible. They will boost the product.
- How do you plan to publicise this product of yours such that people get the incentive and understand the morality of using this product?

2) There‚Äôs many organizations planting trees but in places like South Africa there‚Äôs very little support for the removal of invasive species, do the think same type of support you receive could go into funding the removal of alien trees hindering the developmental native trees?

2560,4767,"Everyone also needs to fully understand one thing...

The animal (meat) isn't the problem. The problem is the human. This is in 2 ways:

1. The AMOUNT of meat we eat, and
2. The SYSTEMS we run our animals in.

Everyone knows about the first one, so I'll let the rest of the thread talk about that... it's more efficient to just eat less meat than dream up some scenario where the entire world goes vegan. So lets start reducing how much meat we eat... but I want to focus on what people say next...

WHAT TYPE OF MEAT

And then they throw the cow under the bus. I want to really get this point across... the problems with cows aren't the cows, it's the HUMAN. It's the system we run our cows in. There ARE actually REGENERATIVE systems where the cow is the LINCHPIN species in sequestering carbon.

All these articles always use data from industrial feedlot environmental impacts. Trucking in feed that cows aren't supposed to eat. Calculating cow farts as methane releases IN THESE SYSTEMS. Calculating methane releases from massive piles of cow manure left to rot anaerobically in concentrated piles that air cannot get into. We use these numbers, then say ""cow bad"". No, the cow isn't bad, the human is bad.

Cows run in cell gracing systems, run through FOREST (or savannah - grassland/forest), in managable numbers, where they eat a natural diet of grasses/flowers/herbs/leaves and don't fart as much, where their manure is spread out, trampled, mixed with leaf litter and grass allowed to go to heavy carbon dry stalk because you didn't overgraze... in these systems the manure degrades aerobically to CO2, and NOT methane (CH4) which is 37 times worse than CO2. In these systems, soil life is INCREASED, storing carbon in their bodies. In these systems grasses are grazed and regrowth is triggered, and allowed to continue to the full life of the grass plant, stored carbon in woody stalks that are then trampled. All this carbon comes from the air.

In feedlots, cows shit on top of shit, on top of shit. They are fed corn and grain, and fart a lot. They are often on compacted depleted soils where urine and manure cannot turn into soil and soil microbiology. The air cannot infiltrate the compacted soils, and manure leachate from rains flows across compacted lands into rivers. It does not infiltrate down INTO the soil, it runs ACROSS on TOP of the soil.

The carbon footprint of the feed system is calculated - trucking in corn and grain.

The solution is eating less meat - sure. But that doesn't mean cows are the problem, and anytime you hear a study like this that references industrial feedlots as their case for meat, it is uninformed. And it's a shame, because large ruminants are CARBON SEQUESTERING MACHINES... just not when they are:

1. overgrazed, such that stalky carbon growth is not allowed to happen - in order to keep grass in the vegetative state
2. Feed is trucked in
3. Manure is concentrated and piled up
4. Run on compacted land (due to overgrazing), or on top of cement..

The problem is that we decided that food and life on this planet needed to become industrialized. We needed to maximize one aspect (profits) at the sake of all other aspects of the system (natural systems).

**Buiding SOIL**

This is a climate change subreddit, but the problems we are facing isn't only carbon in the air. Another massive extinction level threat is the loss of topsoil. We have roughly 55 years of topsoil remaining if we continue industrial farming practices (most notably turning soil over via tilling, fertilizer use, monoculture (corn/soy), and herbicides, i.e. no green cover, bare soil). Cows in silvopasture systems not only prevent soil erosion, but they BUILD soil faster than just about any system on the planet, all automatically as part of their natural habit of feeding and pooping.

It's not just sequestering carbon, it's sequestering carbon in a manner that allows us to build soil. All life on this planet exists based on the fact that we have 3 inches of topsoil and that it rains. And we're losing our topsoil. So turning trees into furniture or biochar and planting more trees does a great job of sequestering carbon, but does little (outside of leaf litter) to build soil. At least not like a large ruminant grazing on grassland/forest.

We need to sequester carbon, yes, but we need to build SOIL also. We NEED to stop demonizing cows, as a matter of human survival, because they are one of the most important animals on the planet. Just not when we use them the wrong way. 

**Repeat and spread this information, please. It never gets mentioned, and we all focus on the above point 1, and not the point #2.**

Again, the problem isn't the cow... the cow is a carbon sequestering linchpin species in a properly run silvopasture system. The PROBLEM IS THE HUMAN. Please spread the word and educate people on this, because as long as we keep demonizing large ruminant animals, we prevent ourselves from setting up more and more silvopasture systems - [which ranks as the 9th most effective thing we can do to reverse climate change](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank).

Note that rank 4 on that list is reducing meat consumption - which is why it IS important also. However also note that the numbers they derive for that are based on INDUSTRIAL FEEDLOT numbers. I'm all for reducing industrial feedlot run cattle to fucking zero. But that doesn't equate to reducing cows and meat consumption to zero.

The tree planting campaigns were amazing in uniting an extremely ethnically and politically divided populace.  It's about the only thing that united this country in the last few years of violence and upheaval.  A beacon of hope when we all needed it.

However, hundreds of thousands of people were planting plants who had no clue what was a flower and what was a tree, let alone what was an indigenous tree.  With little preparation for the first round, nurseries supplied all kinds of plants and they were assumed to be trees by those planting them.   And in most cases, they were! But not all. So street side plantings in Addis Ababa were often planted with flowers.  Care and protection was often done at some level by local administrations, to a level that surprised me but was uneven 

My casual observation over 20 years of distributing indigenous seedlings to farmers is that about 30 percent are alive after five years.  Sorry, I don't have data.  My further observation is that the survival is lower when there is a mass planting in a common area where no one has ownership.  We have seen some plots of indigenous trees owned by the government that have succeeded, and some by private individuals.

Charcoal in Ethiopia.  I have a mixed set of thoughts.  We work in an area where farmers chose about ten years ago, for economic reasons, to mostly convert farmland into charcoal trees, with a four or five year rotation.  Studies have shown this is replenishing the tired soil.  It also is in the Nile basin, with hydroelectric dams downstream in various countries. Presumably four or five years of trees is less silt build up in the hydro dams than five years of annual crops, thus the charcoal trees are protection for the green hydro electric.

Gearing up for the next round of tree planting!  Our nursery is got tens of thousands of seedlings.  Always an exciting time of year for restoration foresters!

You can use that to make little bags for the roots of orchids or other plants that like to live on trees. Then you can tie them on to the tree with hemp or other biodegradable rope and as the fiber degrades over time it makes a little compost to help your flowers or whatever root into the tree.

2634,4952,"1. Elect a Democratic President AND Congress (the President will just be stonewalled by a GOP senate if we don't do both).

2. Prioritize Green New Deal spending based on a cost/benefit analysis of CO2 generated in a 10-year window. This is not the time to build a millions of electric cars because the Whole Life Cycle output is green. We have 10 years to pull our asses out of the fire. A 10-year life cycle is what matters most.

3. Learn and promote the word: SACRIFICE. Conserve. Reduce. Whatever the hell you want to call it, it has to be a way of life in a post-CO2 world. There just aren't enough renewables in place to get CO2 levels down AND maintain our current grotesquely consumptive standard of living. 

4. As part of #3: Make it patriotic and fun to conserve and social taboo to waste. Like in WWII with the homefront effort. Hollywood needs to get onboard, local politicians, churches, community organizations, Girl/Boy Scouts-- we're all about to become heroes by literally saving humanity and much of the world as we know it. We need to feel good and proud about how much of a pain in the ass it's going to be to change our lifestyles.

5. Also as part of #3: RATIONS: Gas for cars and homes, electricity, meat, dairy, clothing, mileage. Anything that's nonessential needs to be cut back.

6. As part of #5: RETRAINING: A lot of people are going to be out of a job in the post-CO2 economy. But we're going to need more repair shops, tailors and seamstresses, craftsmen who repurpose, energy efficient remodelers (once we get into a comfort zone for CO2 and can afford to manufacture nonessential goods), train routes, recycling centers, sailors, etc.

7. Relocate coastal residents inland and convert those lands to nature reserves. Riverfront, oceanfront and some lakefront property needs to be a thing of the past. With flooding and storms, it's unsustainable from both an infrastructure support and natural perspective. We need that land as a carbon sink and natural buffer zone to absorb the weather impacts. Green New Deal can use eminent domain to buy out those areas and pay newly unemployed laborers to environmentally restore them.

8. Four Day Work Week: The amount of CO2 saved if everything nonessential is mandatorily closed one day a week is huge. Airports should also be closed on that day, except for emergency purposes. The shortened week will still be considered full time.

9. Hollywood needs to wake the fuck up. No more shows about bling, big houses, pimping rides, exotic gourmet meals, fabulous over-the-top anything. We need shows about cooking vegetarian, stylish thrift shop wear, growing native plants, growing food, living with a smaller CO2 footprint, etc. AND movies and tv shows need to have characters that do these things just as part of their normal day to day life. Hollywood normalized interracial marriage, working women, homosexuality, smoking pot, etc, etc, etc-- they can normalize a low CO2 lifestyle instead of glamorizing a gluttonous one.

10. Jail time and financial clawbacks (all the way to the heirs and heiresses) of executives who knowingly presided over companies that are the main culprits in the current crisis. New laws that *guarantee* jail time and clawbacks for any executives who currently or in the future continue to conduct business as usual after discovering their product is integral to social/environmental harm.

11. Revamp the packaged goods industry. We don't need an entire shampoo aisle. Or cereal aisle. Or snack chip aisle. Or cleaning supply aisle. Or bread aisle. Etc. We don't need freezer cases full of the same food by 10 different manufacturers. Back to basics. Keep it fresh. Keep it local. Wrap it in paper or not at all. Reusable containers from home will do, too.

12. Of course a carbon tax. The bigger the better.

13. Pipedream, but: A WORLDWIDE TREATY. As a single organization, the US Department of Defense is the biggest consumer of oil and the largest polluter on the planet. We cannot win a war against CO2 without stopping war on everything else. The military industrial complex needs to become the Environmental (renewable)Industrial Complex. Retooled to build renewable power, a renewable grid and innovative new ways to accomplish more with less environmental impact.

There's more, but that'd be a great start. In the meantime, since our world leaders are asleep at the wheel, we need to do everything to stop CO2nsuming and",1 elect democratic president congress the president stonewall gop senate both 2 prioritize green new deal spend base costbenefit analysis co2 generate 10year window time build million electric car whole life cycle output green 10 year pull ass fire 10year life cycle matter most 3 learn promote word sacrifice conserve reduce whatever hell want call it way life postco2 world enough renewable place get co2 level maintain current grotesquely consumptive standard living 4 part 3 make patriotic fun conserve social taboo waste like wwii homefront effort hollywood need get onboard local politician church community organization girlboy scout be become hero literally save humanity much world know it need feel good proud much pain ass go change lifestyle 5 also part 3 ration gas car home electricity meat dairy clothing mileage anything that s nonessential need cut back 6 part 5 retrain lot people go job postco2 economy be go need repair shop tailor seamstresse craftsman repurpose energy efficient remodeler once get comfort zone co2 afford manufacture nonessential good train route recycle center sailor etc 7 relocate coastal resident inland convert land nature reserve riverfront oceanfront lakefront property need thing past flood storm unsustainable infrastructure support natural perspective need land carbon sink natural buffer zone absorb weather impact green new deal use eminent domain buy area pay newly unemployed laborer environmentally restore they 8 four day work week amount co2 save everything nonessential mandatorily closed one day week huge airport also close day except emergency purpose shorten week still consider full time 9 hollywood need wake fuck up show ble big house pimp ride exotic gourmet meal fabulous overthetop anything need show cook vegetarian stylish thrift shop wear grow native plant grow food live small co2 footprint etc movie tv show need character thing part normal day day life hollywood normalize interracial marriage work woman homosexuality smoking pot etc etc etc normalize low co2 lifestyle instead glamorize gluttonous one 10 jail time financial clawback all way heir heiress executive knowingly preside company main culprit current crisis new law guarantee jail time clawback executive currently future continue conduct business usual discover product integral socialenvironmental harm 11 revamp package good industry need entire shampoo aisle cereal aisle snack chip aisle clean supply aisle bread aisle etc need freezer case full food 10 different manufacturer back basic keep fresh keep local wrap paper all reusable container home do too 12 course carbon tax big well 13 pipedream but worldwide treaty single organization we department defense big consumer oil large polluter planet can not win war co2 without stop war everything else military industrial complex need become environmental renewableindustrial complex retool build renewable power renewable grid innovative new way accomplish less environmental impact there s more that d great start meantime since world leader asleep wheel need everything stop co2nsume,465,0.2631578947368421,0.12258064516129032,2020-01-03 00:03:22,1,esg-bullish

2669,5041,"Possibly due to the perpetuation of the myth that the economy is not a zero sum game. In actuality the economy is limited by the ecology's ability to recover from the exploitation by humans in our drive for greater convenience and abundance. This foolish idea that our sustainability is reliant on a competition to see who is able to earn the greatest portion of the monetary wealth will only cause further strain to the ecological resources. Life eats life to live and all life works to earn a living. The argument that the advancements in technologies to improve economic efficiencies will permit this zero sum game to continue without limits is irrational. Historically it can be shown that all advancements in technology has resulted in increased human populations.  There is a limit to the biomass of life on earth and therefore a limit to the growth of our numbers. It is believed that we cannot all continue to live without a fossil fueled industrial complex and the present state of technologies.\* Climate change and species extinction is rampant, wild life in decline, biomass of insects in decline, sterilized mono-culture agriculture is on the rise resulting in massive single points of failure within the supply of the very life energy we require to feed on to live. The house of cards is precarious, yet here we are obligated to continue to prop it up for fear of losing our own individual securities. What the discussion should be is on how best to nurture adapting to a better stronger future. Life is good, Life is work, the economy concerns the business of earning a living, so everyone should be working at earning a living the best they can. Grow life, grow food. Those who have succeeded at the attainment of great inequity of monetary wealth, which was made possible through a withdrawal from the investment of the  prehistoric life energy invested into the  soil of Mother Earth for our benefit, should be responsible for providing the fertilizer for those who either by choice or circumstance find themselves struggling at working at living frugal lives.

2832,5621,"Hey! We‚Äôre on the same team, so please don‚Äôt grab a pitchfork. I want to save the world too. But I think the following is important and will help you get more people on team planet.

The words capitalism and socialism have been abused in the current US political arena and are starting to lose their meaning for many people. So here are the actual definitions:

Capitalism:
‚Äúan economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market‚Äù

Socialism:
‚Äúany of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods‚Äù

So if you look at the definitions of the two systems, neither actually says anything about what resources are taken and how they are used. Rather they just debate who should make those decisions. In either case, the decision is made by humans, all of whom are flawed. 

So some kid‚Äôs lemonade stand or yard mowing ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is, in fact, capitalism. A clean energy company, an electric or hybrid car, a crowdfunded cleanup project, volunteerism, activism, protesting, etc. all of that falls under capitalism. 

Here‚Äôs some basic economic theory. You and I are on a desert island and I have found bananas whereas you have found coconuts. However, each of us prefers the opposite fruit. So we cooperate and voluntarily trade these fruit, and both end up better off than we started. Our total subjective value has increased, and as such ‚Äúwealth‚Äù has been created. Add a few more people and fruits to this exchange mix, and you might have trouble finding the right barter trade bc the person who has your preferred fruit doesn‚Äôt like the one you found. Rather than playing a long and painful game of musical fruit, you could give something else valuable, like shells. If everyone likes shells then you can use these as an economic lubricant that facilitates faster and easier trade. Now you have money. The additional benefit of your shell money is that you can better represent how much ‚Äúwealth‚Äù you have helped create for others and can even save that up for the future. Shells are fragile so you pay someone a small fee to store them for you (banks) and eventually just get IOU statements rather than carrying large amounts of shells (fiat currency). You collect lots of coconuts and trade them for lots of shells with the surrounding islanders, creating lots of wealth (capital) in the process. Furthermore, you discover that planting coconuts yields coconut trees so you make a grove (also capital) and use that to amass more wealth. Keep in mind, so far everyone has engaged in mutually beneficial voluntary trade and everyone is better off. 

The break between capitalism and socialism comes next. 

You grow older and don‚Äôt want to spend all of your time collecting coconuts. You realize that you can sell each coconut for 10 shells, and that some of the younger islanders are willing to pick coconuts for you for only 2 shells. So you pay three or four young islanders the bare minimum they are willing to take and you take in huge profits. The young islanders are angry that you are exploiting them, asking why they should get paid so little when they are doing all the work and you are ‚Äúdoing nothing.‚Äù You counter that you took the time, effort, and risk of creating the coconut grove and as such it is your private property (capitalism). They counter that you should pay them more or they will all join forces and quit together (unions, still capitalism). You concede and now pay them 4 shells, still making a decent profit. Society develops and you are ordered to pay a living wage, provide health benefits, paid sick/maternity/family leave, taxes, etc, and now your expenses rise to 8 shells. You even include the workers on decisions you make regarding the grove. (still capitalism). Later society also realizes that your grove is causing erosion (negative externality) and they order you to pay to clean up your mess and save the environment (internalization of externality, still capitalism). 

The above system would never become socialism until the state (or ‚Äúsociety‚Äù) said that you no longer have rights to the grove you built (the means of production). 

Let‚Äôs say that the workers, rather than identifying you as selfish, a bad boss, a jerk, etc, change their rhetoric and state that any value created via coconut production is theirs, not yours. The investment you made in creating the grove (capital) needs to be run by ‚Äúsociety.‚Äù Society takes the grove from you and decides what gets grown, how much, and to whom it goes. Beyond being quite unfair and unjust (and potentially violent) for taking your private property from you, this also gives a significant disincentive for future entrepreneurs to consider planting their own groves. And then the question arises of who decides how to use your grove. In the worst case, an unscrupulous demagogue could weasel his way into command and order that only bananas be grown, or that all of the native habitat be destroyed to increase yields. He could even pocket some of the fruit or shells for himself, or abuse his power for social or political gains. But even in the best case, he doesn‚Äôt have perfect knowledge. You had to guess how many coconuts to plant based on how many people you thought would buy them and for how much. Without that wealth signal, the social planner has much less information on how valuable the laborer‚Äôs time, the land, the water, etc. Furthermore, he would have no way to calculate the cost of negative externalities and include those in his decision matrix. I could go on for a while, but basically the fear is that fruit island socialism will eventually destroy wealth as socialism did in the USSR, Cuba, China, and Venezuela (among others). 

Ok, so I know the metaphor is fairly contrived but the basic point is neither capitalism nor socialism dictates that resources must be used in a sustainable fashion. Comparing the two is no more useful than saying earth is suffering from ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and we need to return to monarchy because we had lower emissions back then. 

The bigger challenge we face currently is the lack of political will to internalize negative externalities. That means we need to ensure that any person, corporation, or government that pollutes or otherwise destroys the planet bears the cost of mitigating or cleaning up the mess they made. This means holding BP accountable for the millions of barrels of oil they spilled in the gulf; making them pay for the whole cleanup. This means taxing carbon emissions both to discourage use and to fund carbon capture technologies.

2845,5686,"Truth; I‚Äôm of the opinion that a lot of our current issues stem from an imbalance between state and federal power. Most decisions should happen at a local or state level, because California and Alabama are almost separate countries. We get in a lot of trouble, I think, when we place too much power at the federal level, resulting in individuals from very different backgrounds legislatively forcing their culture on each other. 

We still need a strong federal government, but mostly to protect us from outside forces and to address issues too big for any one state to handle like corrupt mega corporations and climate change.

I totally agree that the situation the US is screwed up currently, and it absolutely kills me that individuals are suffering when we have so much more than enough for everyone. I really do think this situation could be mostly reversed by a strong UBI or probably more preferably a Negative Income tax that guaranteed say $20,000-$30,000 income to anyone not making that much (with a 50% taper as total income approached $50K). Not sure, but that‚Äôs where my current thought process is at. 

I actually agree with a lot of the content on r/LateStageCapitalism with the exception that I would rename it late stage corporatism, consumerism, cronyism, materialism, etc. I just don‚Äôt think that true socialism or communism is fair where Joe loses his auto shop or John loses his farm. And I certainly don‚Äôt trust the Federal Government to be any better steward of those resources than these individuals or companies are.

So how do we fix it?

We need a constitutional amendment that the government cannot bail out any corporation. Similarly we need an amendment to dismantle the lobbying system and get money out of politics.

3792,0,"One thing to note is that there's barely any regulation of what constitutes ESG investing. Indeed, the best I've heard is ""socially responsible investing is whatever the investor believes it is."" For me, the best example of this is Shell. Oil producing companies can't be green can they? Well, most esg scores are comparing a company to its overall industry so it may well come out looking very green. They also invest in renewables so depending on the screens used it may look like a green investment. 

There were a few WSJ investigations and found that there were essentially zero correlation between esg scores of one provider compared to another, and that many funds had just changed their name to include the word"" green"" or ""sustainable"" etc without changing the portfolio.

Theoretically speaking, imagine a company like PG Tips. How can one accurately or precisely estimate its environmental impact? Are they going to annually sample their farms, their HQ for water usage etc? And then consider that PG Tips' score will get augmented with all the other Unilever subsidiaries into one value. It seems like an absurd task to me.

Crucially, large caps like the Vanguard one will contain almost the same as a normal world index, but likely have higher fees. I wouldn't recommend it imo, and go for a big standard world index with low fees.

I would also note that you're investing in the secondary market - unless the company is issuing shares (v unlikely) then your investment won't have a direct impact. ESG investing is all about incentivising management to act ethically - the Church of England have shares in Amazon, for example, to lobby for workers' rights.

3800,8,"So full disclosure I work for a SRI/ESG Financial Planner. There is actually a list (or a few lists) out there of interesting CFPs who do all manner of socially responsible wealth management. A good place to start us USSIF (https://www.ussif.org/) most SRI/ESG peeps out there affiliate with these guys. 

Also check with your employer or whomever manages your accounts to see if they already have something in place. I say that only because going to an independent RIA who specializes in SRI can be a bit expensive and/or you need to have a good amount of investable assets. 

Avoiding fossil fuels is pretty easy, it is when you get into the nitty gritty of other things where it gets weird. Ie, a lot of big SRI/ESG ETFs and Mutual funds invest in Facebook, Apple, etc. If you want to avoid carbon emissions and do any one other thing around social justice (minority/female board representation, workers rights, etc) the universe of assets you can invest in shrinks really quickly. For example: the GAP low-ish carbon footprint (because they are a store); largely female leadership with a pipeline of other female leaders (some of them even POC!) Double good. Then Boom! Fast casual is one of the biggest users of forced labor camps in China of which the GAP has been implicated.

 That should not scare you away, just take a minute to figure out where your lines in the sand are; things like no fossil fuel might be a solid one but maybe board diversity doesn't bother you as long as the overall company is doing good work. That way you can communicate those beliefs easily to either your current advisor or a new one.

3823,31,"Sustainability is a pretty meaningless term that companies like to use to make their products more appealing to the eco-conscious consumer. The best eco-friendly solution would be for fashion companies to shut their doors and only allow for second-hand to be purchased thus reducing and prohibiting any textile waste from being created but we know that's impossible. Capitalism drives companies to sell as much as possible so even if the textiles are being produce in a way that impacts the environment a little less than another technique the sheer volume of goods they're producing and selling will inevitably impact the environment catastrophically. They are just slowing the inevitable, by simply existing they are a detriment to this planet. That being said we all love our luxury goods whether they are real or fake but limiting what you buy is really the only way to stop emissions and save the planet, but if everyone did that it would cause these companies to collapse since they wouldn't move any inventory. This creates a game of convincing the consumer that their purchases will have a lesser impact on the environment and ""greenwash"" their products to make it more friendly for the eco-conscious consumer which makes this sustainability trend meaningless since it is all about selling product and not a real solution to the issue. That being said worker's rights is something that companies have more control over and it is shocking to see how low LVMH ranked but not surprising. When we think about fake luxury fashion we are made to think of terrorism, child labor and drugs but we seldom discuss the abuses that are happening from the luxury houses like LVMH. Since the price is so high we are made to think that they are crafted with the upmost care and workers are treated like royalty but it just shows you how much marketing and fear mongering can sway the opinion of the masses.

USV 2021 Fund
Andy Weissman
Andy Weissman ‚Äì Jan 26, 2021

We are pleased to announce that USV has raised a 2021 Core Fund with commitments of $250 million. This Core Fund will complement our new Climate Fund and existing Opportunity Fund. This will be USV‚Äôs seventh early-stage venture fund since the firm was founded in 2003. 

As before, we continue to invest with a thesis-driven approach, the USV Thesis 3.0: 

Trusted brands that broaden access to knowledge, capital, and well-being by leveraging networks, platforms, and protocols

We believe this thesis is as relevant today as when we articulated it in April 2018.

This past year has seen fundamental (and likely permanent) behavioral changes such as the growth in distance learning, increased usage of telemedicine and asynchronous digital health delivery, and the rise of remote work. These changes accelerated digitalization of tech stacks that in other industries have often been a precursor to falling costs and wider access (e.g., ecommerce). These are the types of opportunities we have been focused on since the beginning of Thesis 3.0. 

We are particularly interested in understanding companies that are finding ways to broaden access to learning and healthcare by creating new, trusted solutions. For example, education is largely taught the same way today as it has been historically ‚Äì a physical arena where people join for classes. Medical care as well ‚Äì  big changes in 2020 notwithstanding. What are the ways to make people ‚Äì learners and patients ‚Äì the center of these markets? We aim to find not only the direct application of these solutions, but also those that serve the solutions.

Companies we‚Äôve invested in like Duolingo, Outschool, Quizlet, Codecademy, Sora Schools and Skillshare broaden access to knowledge; Nurx, Brave Health, and Modern Fertility broaden access to wellbeing. These are good guideposts which we will continue to focus on: either direct to learner/patient or an enabling layer to fuel the direct to learner/patient market. We also look to expand the definition of what this means ‚Äì for example, we are particularly interested in mental health companies that may not look like healthcare businesses at all.

Access to knowledge means education but also tools and platforms that support how knowledge is shared and remembered in organizations or groups, including in this new, more remote world.

Wellbeing to us includes healthcare but also community and fun. New delivery mediums (such as audio) present ways to bring high-density kinds of information to more people for entertainment, healthcare, learning or other purposes. This includes companies like Abridge, Headgum, Wattpad and Meet Cute. Here we also look for new tools and technology-enabled production methodologies.

Similarly, access to capital remains concentrated. Companies like Possible, Stash, Teamshares and Noah broaden services to more people, on better terms through innovations in business models, underlying infrastructure, or new ways of reaching the customer. We also continue to look for ideas that center on collaborative solutions to capital problems ‚Äì multiplayer fintech, if you will. 

As in our last several funds, we expect a significant portion of the investments -around 30%- will be crypto-related investments. This will include holding tokens directly as well as equity in early-stage blockchain-related projects. Crypto networks embody both the evolution of trust in computing and financial systems, as well as vastly expanded access, so we view crypto networks as completely aligned with Thesis 3.0. We believe the opportunity to decentralize systems is still in early stages, seeing adoption tailwinds, and with a lot of interesting new activity.

As always, we remain committed to our way of practicing venture capital and finding those companies that believe we can be great partners. Our funds are small. Our focus is thesis-driven. Our website is a compilation of ideas from ourselves and others, constantly evolving yet always open and public. We publish our investment memos as blog posts. We are active partners to all the companies we invest in at all times. And our decision making is collaborative (we don‚Äôt vote).¬†

3849,57,"We need to change how we understand taxes, which in turn will change how we understand society.

Broadly speaking, things that happen in a community should benefit the community (or at least be more of a benefit than a detriment).  At the micro level, this is easily understood: violent crime and destruction of property is bad, cleanliness and friendly neighbours are good.  People understand what it looks like to benefit the community at the micro level because direct causal relationships are super simple.

At the macro level, things get hazy.

Is a company that provides a means for people in the community to convert labour into productivity at the cost of polluting the local water supply good?  Is a needle exchange that provides shelter for addicts but makes them visible to the community bad?

Government and taxation enters the picture here as a solution to that question.  Because it's difficult for a larger entity to comprehensively comport themselves in a manner which unequivocally ""benefits the community"", you outsource that burden to government, who steps in and says ""you don't have to worry about micromanaging yourself for the benefit of the community, we'll take care of that for you, but in exchange you have to give us money to do what you should have done on your behalf"".  It further follows that tax breaks for businesses make sense if they reduce the burden on government to manage their impact on the community (since they shouldn't pay someone else to do something they're already doing).  What does and doesn't constitute them taking responsibility for their actions is up for discussion, but that's a different matter.

Things like paid sick leave are why this conversation needs to be had.  People being unable to tend to their own health because of work obligations is a community detriment directly caused by the existence of commercial activity.  SOMEONE needs to be responsible for this identifiable and measurable issue, and either that's the businesses or it's the government on their behalf.

This division between explicit and ambiguous detriments is why this conversation is so difficult to have.  You wouldn't tolerate a business that murders children in the community because that's bad, but a business that directly, measurably contributes to reductions in child safety due to pollution and burdens placed on parents is ""complicated"".

The conversation we should be having - the one a lot of talking heads want to steer you away from for vague reasons - is a ground-up community assessment: look at what problems exist in the community, look at the sources causing those problems, and then look at how to address those problems from the perspective that ""everything that happens in the community should benefit the community, and if it doesn't, the things causing the detriment need to remediate the detriment or pay someone else to do so"".

People unambiguously understand ""if someone murders, they should go to jail as a penalty because murdering hurts the community"", but thanks to decades of subtle messaging guidance, that same logic doesn't apply to ""if someone weighs down the community with malicious business practices, they should be penalized for hurting the community by being forced to undo the hurt they caused"".

Going back to fashion, sustainability is in the eye of the beholder. Is Hermes practicing sustainability by limiting the number of bags they release? Depends on who's asking. How does BoF come up with metrics? Are these metrics the gold standard in the industry? So many questions and factors to consider. But at the end of the day, we the consumers, hold the key to sustainability. We can dictate how much we want these fashion houses to produce and how they should ethically produce their products. We should be cautious in buying the idea that some companies are 'green' while at the same breathe they are part of the fast fashion.

Timber is the energy of the future: modern industrial wood burners outperform nuclear reactors in terms of fuel efficiency (obviously the individual output is far lower), and properly seasoned timber produces as much CO2 burned as it would if it was left to rot, which is the exact same amount of CO2 that the tree consumed in its life. 

Fell and burn 999 trees and plant 1,000 and you're still removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Industrial wood driers can season timber in as little as two hours--down from 12-18 months in air. Fell the tree at breakfast, dry it at lunch, and it'll be powering the telly by teatime. 

Young trees and fast growing species remove an enormous amount of CO2 from the air and soil in a matter of months. If we can regenerate brownfield sites and turn them into arable land for timber we can have 24 hour forestry operations in urban and semi-urban areas, providing depolluting green zones and seasonal recreation areas (not to mention the benefits to mental health) in otherwise worthless land with a very short carbon chain to the power plants, as well as green belts to demarcate boroughs and assist the migration and repopulation of wildlife.

4072,280,"So I am not a financial advisor do not take this as advice to buy or invest in anything, please do your own research. However, there are actually quite a few Islamic funds out there; getting a decent advisor, or even better one who specializes in religious thematic investing will probably be able to get you going assuming you are a legal resident of the country you are in. 
Two things I would add, unless you are going to give yourself a serious crash course in analyzing a company and public investing I would get someone else to do it for you. The chances that you 1) make a bad bet and loose big are pretty good and/or 2) pick a company that looks fine on the surface only to find they somehow affiliate with something or one who is  counter your religious beliefs. 
The other thing is that unless you have a LOT of money to invest and live very simply the chances that at 35 you will be able to live off of your investments alone is pretty low. The general rule is if you can live off of roughly 4% of the money you have invested you can likely live off the interest forever. For example if you had ¬£150,000 to invest you could potentially make around ¬£60,000 in interest which after taxes works out to be roughly 40,000 in take home (assuming a steady 4% return a year which cannot be guaranteed). 
I don't want to throw cold water on your thoughts but it sounds like finding a good financial advisor (perhaps through you mosque or religious connections) who understands your religious needs around wealth would be a good place to start. That way you can work together to build your wealth in a way that aligns with your beliefs. There are ones that charge a fee per service or ones that have you on a commission or flat fee. Depends on your needs.

They launched a range of ESG funds recently, and have said that they want to have a stronger influence on companies and use voting rights to do so.

For example, the ""ESG Advanced"" funds like [USXF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314365/) has good exposure to US large/mid-cap stocks and [DMXF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314362/) does the same for non-US stocks. By all accounts, these look better to me than Vanguard's ESG offerings, though I'm not an expert. BlackRock also has the newer ""ESG Aware"" funds, but these include companies like Apple that you don't want.

I would add a general note that a problem with wanting to invest responsibly is that there's no evidence yet that it has any impact on anything. Investing in a company does not ""prop up"" its share price and does not make the company more viable in any way, and _not_ investing in a company doesn't hurt that company.

Yes there‚Äôs a ton of green washing but the industry is very new and is now getting up the curve. Firms are hiring a ton of ESG professionals to start having more robust analysis beyond the SDGs and MSCI. The capital and products have outrun the analysis but the analysis is growing.

Secondly, a lot of ESG is not supposed to be social impact. It‚Äôs not supposed to be similar to philanthropy or impact investing. At my firm we use it as another component to analyze how we weight companies in our portfolio. Sometimes we overweight strong actors or negative screen for bad actors. It also allows us to create nuanced funds for clients with issue specific mana dates (like overweight companies with strong renewables investment in a portfolio for a client who cares about the environment)

A lot of this ends up being renewable energy like high flows at dams and solar peaks that are not matched to local demand.

4371,584,"Matt Levine has written many amusing things about corporate governance over the years so I recommend reading him.

But one thing to point out is that concentration of power is generally needed to exercise power in a meaningful way, because the opinions of individuals are often inconsistent and they are often working at cross purposes.

One example of this might be workers forming a union to do collective bargaining. Another is that buying things from Walmart or Costco gets you discounts because these company‚Äôs buyers have a lot more power over manufacturers than you will have on your own.

And of course, representative democracy itself is a concentration of power. Extremely concentrated in the case of the US President.

Whenever this happens there is a principal-agent problem. The Will of the People is a sort of myth justifying concentration of power. It doesn‚Äôt mean individuals are happy with what their supposed agent is doing and often they are strongly against it.

Also, individual stockholders delegate and concentrate their power in corporations, often indirectly via ETF‚Äôs and mutual funds, to the extent that the Will of the Stockholders is a kind of mystical thing. In some cases there are actual stockholders sitting on the board of directors and they can say what they want, but what the mass of stockholders actually want is basically a matter of faith. You can sort of tell by looking at the stock price but this is a noisy signal and it‚Äôs a matter of interpretation, like reading tea leaves.

It seems like corporations are a concentration of power, making it *possible* to exercise that power for various purposes, but what they should do with that power is pretty unclear, and most stockholders don‚Äôt have any idea. If they diversify then they might not even know the company exists.

4386,601,"I'm actually pretty confused by this essay, in a way that makes me think I'm missing something basic. I've only seen lefties mention CSR as an on-its-face-ludicrous idea that buying into capitalist ideology will lead you to.

The obvious test case is: a company pollutes a river in a way which they realize will harm many people downstream, but which would be very difficult to detect and trace back to the company. They could prevent this pollution with an expensive mitigation system (which will only decrease profits, even in the long term), or they could let the people downstream be harmed. I think everyone should agree that the company has a clear moral obligation not to knowingly cause this harm. But the plain meaning of the phrase ""The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits"" indicates to me that Friedman disagrees?

By my reading of the essay, it's somehow ""undemocratic"" to ask the factory owner not to pollute, which makes no sense to me. My view is that ""people doing good things is good"": I think excessive pollution / contributions to climate change are bad, so I think it's good when private companies choose to use their own power in a way that mitigates these problems. It's actually somewhat hard for me to see how I *could* be convinced that private companies *shouldn't* voluntarily do more to combat climate change. *All* corporate actions are undemocratic, after all; corporations aren't democratic governments. So that doesn't seem to enter into the equation -- I think they should choose to do good things instead of choosing not doing good things.

But as I said, the whole line of argument leaves me so confused that I'm probably missing something.

4401,618,"I wrote my master's thesis on a CSR topic:

There are two questions to answer here. The first is the one that you grapple with, which is essentially the moral question of whether business agents should have the power to utilize shareholder resources to pursue 'social good'. It's an interesting question, to be sure, but is ultimately a disagreement about values; I believe it possible to be morally consistent for the side of ""the business of business is business"" and the side that business needs to act with wider society in mind. I would have to dig through my old references to find scholarly arguments against the Friedman side - of which there are several serious efforts - but for a beginner's book summary, Robert Frank's ""What Price the Moral High Ground?"" is worth seeking out.

However, the second question you only touch upon: should companies pursue CSR because it aligns with shareholder interest? Now, it has been three years since my thesis was published and I do not actively follow the literature, but at the time the evidence was quite robust that CSR does align with shareholder interest. Companies with CSR commitments outperform those without. And when I say ""outperform"", let me stress that this is not just naive correlations of CSR investment with profit levels or other such statistical handwaving. For example, one of the arguments in favour of organizations pursuing CSR was human resources - the standard of candidate is markedly higher (and a lot more cost efficient than salaries or benefits).",write master thesis csr topic two question answer here first one grapple with essentially moral question whether business agent power utilize shareholder resource pursue social good interesting question sure ultimately disagreement value believe possible morally consistent side the business business business side business need act wide society mind would dig old reference find scholarly argument friedman side several serious effort beginner book summary robert frank what price moral high ground worth seek out however second question touch upon company pursue csr align shareholder interest now three year since thesis publish actively follow literature time evidence quite robust csr align shareholder interest company csr commitment outperform without say outperform let stress naive correlation csr investment profit level statistical handwaving example one argument favour organization pursue csr human resource standard candidate markedly high and lot cost efficient salary benefit,137,-0.5555555555555556,0.19708029197080293,2021-01-19 15:12:57,-1,esg-bearish
4403,620,"I work at one of the worlds largest asset managers, and we have slowly seen a transition and focus from investors into ESG funds over time. My loose, unstructured thoughts below

* ESG is a spectrum, as you mentioned. There are generally agreed upon restrictions for ESG investing, such as investing in landmine producing companies - but the lines become quite blurred dependent upon the house view, external agency view and the client view. For example: would you invest in a company that generates 33% of its revenue from increasing education access for minorities or in deprived areas; but the other 66% is made up of revenue from training fighter pilots and corporate media-training? How do you rate this company on a scale? How does the client view this company?
* There have been studies on the effectiveness of ESG - namely that higher scores on an ESG scale tend to be stocks that perform well. I largely think that this analysis is driven by the ‚ÄúG‚Äù - if you invest in companies with crappy governance, you may experience the stock blowing up due to some unfortunate ‚ÄúG‚Äù disaster. Lately, you are seeing excess returns derived from higher ‚ÄúE‚Äù as the cost of renewables has decreased over the last decade, a trend which should hopefully continue. The ‚ÄúS‚Äù is the hardest, and most blurred - I would say that this type of investing (i.e. having a predefined outcome when you enter) as it doesn‚Äôt always increase the price of the stock; adding extra females to the board, hiring more diverse talent, donating profits etc. are all brilliant initiatives that pay off in the long run but do little to move the price over a medium term.
* As with clients, I think it is better to ask what you believe in first - this creates an ideal benchmark.

4416,635,"It's ironic that in an article on Milton Friedman we get

>It feels very strange to me to argue that (1) companies have too much power and influence, therefore (2) we should encourage companies to exercise their influence in ever-widening spheres. 

Which I'm sure would have given Milton a smile, followed immediately by 

>If we believe companies have too much power, the right response is to vote in governments to check it, not to mandate that they set their own arbitrary definitions of ‚Äògreater good‚Äô and work towards that.

When [Friedman's position on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQyJNDY9nEg) was that in practice, companies have too much power [because of government intervention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agdlsgaMzWg). Government intervention's result, despite stated intent, ends up *increasing* corporate power.

His position was [that social responsibility rests with individual people (timestamp)](https://youtu.be/ev_Uph_TLLo?t=173) because institutions  and other inanimate things can't have responsibility, only people can have responsibility. And further that of the problems people face which call out for social responsibility [almost all of them are a result of government action](https://youtu.be/Rls8H6MktrA).

>But critics of Friedman who advance this line of argument should be explicit and honest with themselves: they are advocating replacing democracy with technocracy, a system where the resolution of the challenges facing humans are best left to unelected experts.

I personally would be much more sympathetic and understanding if people were willing to own up to this. It would be much easier to keep things civil. Unfortunately in most cases people arguing for corporate responsibility either don't understand the implications of their demands, or they are unwilling to acknowledge them.

>You can evaluate whether a marketing campaign was successful or not, but it‚Äôs much harder to determine whether a brand‚Äôs overall positioning is profit-maximising
>... I think the founders of such companies are trying to do good; still, one would have to be incredibly naive to not realise that the charitable component of their companies is a point of difference vs incumbents, and appeals to their demographics.

This is IMO the important nuance of the argument. Entrepreneurs often target a niche either because they themselves care about it, or know a lot about it. Often extant companies lack that knowledge and can't target it without coming off as tonedeaf (e.g. [Kendal Jenner's Pepsi ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwvAgDCOdU4)). I often see people arguing that a company could make more profit by not targeting their niche, without recognizing that the people who own and run the company may be targeting that niche because it is where their specific talents and knowledge give them an advantage. 

Maximizing profit isn't merely about choosing the most profitable segment of a larger market, but about choosing the segment which *you and your employees* specifically are best able to serve competitively. There may frequently be things that would objectively raise profits, but which the specific people involved are unable to think of or unable to execute on for one reason or another. In that case it's rational for them to choose a ""less profitable"" action because it is the most profitable action they specifically can take in practice.",ironic article milton friedman get it feel strange argue 1 company much power influence therefore 2 encourage company exercise influence everwidene sphere I m sure would give milton smile follow immediately if believe company much power right response vote government check it mandate set arbitrary definition great good work towards that friedman position thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvqyjndy9neg practice company much power because government interventionhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvagdlsgamzwg government intervention result despite state intent end increase corporate power position that social responsibility rest individual people timestamphttpsyoutubeev_uph_tllot173 institution inanimate thing ca nt responsibility people responsibility problem people face call social responsibility almost result government actionhttpsyoutuberls8h6mktra but critic friedman advance line argument explicit honest themselves advocate replace democracy technocracy system resolution challenge face human well leave unelected expert personally would much sympathetic understand people willing this would much easier keep thing civil unfortunately case people argue corporate responsibility either understand implication demand unwilling acknowledge they you evaluate whether marketing campaign successful not its much hard determine whether brand overall positioning profitmaximising think founder company try good still one would incredibly naive realise charitable component company point difference vs incumbent appeal demographic imo important nuance argument entrepreneur often target niche either care it know lot it often extant company lack knowledge ca nt target without come tonedeaf eg kendal jenner pepsi adhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuwvagdcodu4 often see people argue company could make profit target niche without recognize people run company may target niche specific talent knowledge give advantage maximizing profit merely choose profitable segment large market choosing segment you employee specifically well able serve competitively may frequently thing would objectively raise profit specific people involve unable think unable execute one reason another case rational choose less profitable action profitable action specifically take practice,280,-0.08108108108108109,0.13214285714285715,2021-01-19 15:41:49,-1,esg-bearish

4446,669,"It's somewhat of an incomplete thought to only ask if companies should be responsible for CSR because the other half is to ask, if not companies, then who holds social responsibility?

Friedman's idea was that we should scrap pretty much all government social programs and pay a reverse income tax, and then if shareholders wanted to promote other social issues then they can do so with their own dividends. Personally, I agree. 

However, the problem is more of a cultural issue. I'm not sure exactly what the cause is, but it seems like people would rather provide inefficient help because it makes them feel better. They'd rather force a company to placate them with CSR campaigns than give their own money to a cause, even if it means both them and their cause get less money in the end. They'd rather give a person a sandwich that costs $5 because of bloated administrative costs than just give the person $2 to make the sandwich themselves because of the suspicion that they might decide to spend that $2 on something else.

Most people don't want to be efficient or successful. They want to feel in control, and what better way to feel in control than bullying mega corporations into placating to your will?

I don't think that is the case.

I think the main reason to hold some of these other investments is that they are less/un correlated with the stock market, so you can build a more efficient portfolio if you include them.

European equities have moved to Amsterdam and Paris from London, while some derivatives contracts have shifted out of Europe altogether in favor of Wall Street platforms.

4566,805,"This was an interesting read, I think it is hard for people who don't have a large background in corporate finance to understand the arguments against Stakeholder vs Shareholder capitalism, I found the article [here](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2019/08/from-shareholder-wealth-to-stakeholder.html) quite illuminating. I think your article makes a couple of interesting points in summary what I got was that, stakeholders capitalism doesn't mean we get unicorns and fairies (the Koch brothers advocating for deregulation was a good example), and that companies can still advocating for progressive causes while increasing profits aligning with shareholders (Toms, Like a girl campaign etc.) .

&#x200B;

I still however remain unconvinced about shareholder capitalism, while I get the theory of shareholder capitalism, I think it is more of the implementation/culture of shareholder capitalisms that people criticize more than the theory. Take for example stock buy backs, despite some companies spending close to their market cap on stock buy backs over the course of a decade the stock won't even grow (IBM, GE, CITI) , never the less  buybacks continue with these companies and not on other types of capitol allocation like M&A, or R&D. I think what people would want, is managers and employees to have more autonomy over how to run their business rather than having to answer to some Hedge Fund manger every quarter about why they haven't given a better stock buyback yet. Yes Friedman is right in that corporations can only focus on profits or free cash flow, and not on some fuzzy concept of social responsibility.  I do think it is the responsibility of the government to align shareholder value with profits though, even Charles Koch would argue that not all profits are good for society. Some examples could be having stock buybacks be taxed like dividends, incentivizing more R&D through tax breaks, and giving managers/other stakeholder more voting rights over corporate governance (perhaps Germany's two tier system could be a good model for this [Aktiengesellschaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft)).",interesting read think hard people large background corporate finance understand argument stakeholder vs shareholder capitalism find article herehttpsaswathdamodaranblogspotcom201908fromshareholderwealthtostakeholderhtml quite illuminating think article make couple interesting point summary get that stakeholder capitalism mean get unicorn fairy the koch brother advocate deregulation good example company still advocate progressive cause increase profit align shareholder tom like girl campaign etc x200b still however remain unconvinced shareholder capitalism get theory shareholder capitalism think implementationculture shareholder capitalism people criticize theory take example stock buy back despite company spend close market cap stock buy back course decade stock even grow ibm ge citi never less buyback continue company type capitol allocation like ma rd think people would want manager employee autonomy run business rather answer hedge fund manger every quarter give well stock buyback yet yes friedman right corporation focus profit free cash flow fuzzy concept social responsibility think responsibility government align shareholder value profit though even charle koch would argue profit good society example could stock buyback tax like dividend incentivize rd tax break give managersother stakeholder voting right corporate governance perhaps germany two tier system could good model aktiengesellschafthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiaktiengesellschaft,184,-0.17647058823529413,0.09239130434782608,2021-01-19 16:09:30,-1,esg-bearish

I totally understand you wanting it all to just be over, I was the same. We had a (very) abnormal NT scan at 12 weeks, followed by a NIPT and CVS at the MFM (their scan confirmed that the NT/cystic hygroma was very large and getting worse). For us, having each test come back with consistent results helped, in a way. It was the hardest decision we've ever had to make, but being certain about the diagnosis made us feel more sure in our decision to terminate at almost 16 weeks.

Could you call the department that will do the termination and start to set up an appointment? It can always be cancelled or moved based on your results, but at least then you'd know.

4927,1227,"""e.g the companies with a female CEO""

I'm not going to ever invest in a company simply because it has a female CEO. There are female CEOs who are not good (Ginni Rometty at IBM, for example.) There are very good female CEOs (Mandy Ginsberg of Match, Sarah Friar was effectively CEO of Square and should have been made CEO - she was fantastic there, I don't own it but Lisa Su of AMD is another example; there was a great female CEO at INGR who turned the company around and then she left and the stock went South) I'm looking for *good* CEOs, whether they are female or male.

""investing in green companies""

I'm not going to invest in green businesses because they are green. Something I find very irritating is the view that ""it's green and therefore it must be good."" People said ""it's solar so it must be good"" a lot about SunEdison right into bankruptcy.  There were shareholders of that company who spent a ridiculous amount of money on legal fees to create a shareholder committee because they thought the bankruptcy process was being used to ""steal the company from them."" There are letters to the judge that show no comprehension of the possibility that it was a shitty fucking company, but only that it was solar so therefore it was ""saving the planet."" Those people lost twice: they lost on the stock and they lost money on a legal battle there was no way on earth they'd ever win. 

I'm certainly not against investing in green companies, but it has to be something that I feel checks all the boxes that I'd use when looking at anything else and solar panels (for example) just don't do that - there is no moat. So I'm certainly not against, but I definitely don't think that something green is automatically a good business. I look at ""green"" companies like I'd look at anything else and either it checks the boxes and I'll consider investing or it doesn't.

I have started to much more look at workplace reviews in the last year and factored that more into decision making.

""companies with ethical governance""

I don't think people in this era really seem to care that much about strong corporate governance. ESG investing is big absolutely but I really do think that there is a portion of younger people that care a lot about the E and the S but not the G.

Additionally, MSCI certainly continues to see benefit in the growth from ESG but nobody talks about investing in ESG in that sense.

There's few limitations on what I'll invest in, both in terms of sector and globally.  There's definitely a couple of sectors from an ethical standpoint and a couple of sectors I avoid because they're largely mediocre businesses, but most things I'll consider.",eg company female ceo I m going ever invest company simply female ceo female ceo good ginni rometty ibm example good female ceo mandy ginsberg match sarah friar effectively ceo square make ceo fantastic there lisa su amd another example great female ceo ingr turn company around left stock go south I m look good ceo whether female male invest green company I m go invest green business green something find irritate view its green therefore must good people say its solar must good lot sunedison right bankruptcy shareholder company spend ridiculous amount money legal fee create shareholder committee think bankruptcy process use steal company they letter judge show comprehension possibility shitty fucking company solar therefore save planet people lose twice lose stock lose money legal battle way earth they d ever win I m certainly invest green company something feel check box I d use look anything else solar panel for example moat I m certainly against definitely think something green automatically good business look green company like i d look anything else either check box ill consider investing do nt start much look workplace review last year factor decision make company ethical governance think people era really seem care much strong corporate governance esg invest big absolutely really think portion young people care lot e g additionally msci certainly continue see benefit growth esg nobody talk invest esg sense there s limitation ill invest in term sector globally there s definitely couple sector ethical standpoint couple sector avoid they re largely mediocre business thing ill consider,258,0.3333333333333333,0.1511627906976744,2020-01-23 12:17:10,1,esg-bullish

More power to you in thinking about using your money this way.

ESG investing has been around for decades but has grown a lot over the last few years. There are more options than ever. 

There are decisions you should make when thinking about investing this way. What are the ESG factors that are important to you in determining you'll invest in a company? Because there (so far) there aren't universal standards across the finance industry as to what is ESG or isn't. Do your research to understand what factors an ESG fund considers.

1. I mostly invest in ETFs that have ESG criteria. SPYX is the SP500 excluding companies with fossil fuel reserves. It has outperformed VOO over the last 5 years. It still includes lots of not great companies that fail on other ESG criteria. (It still includes tobacco companies, gun manufacturers, companies with bad labor practices)

2. When I invest in individual companies I choose to invest in ones that do follow good ESG principles and they make me plenty of money. I currently am invested in CRM, MSFT, DIS and HBI. 

Here's an overview of ESG investing from the Financial Times that you might find useful:

5011,1329,"Ultimately, I think when you are investing in a company, you have to make calls about what your money is going towards.

For example, I will never invest in Comcast. I hate the company, their culture, their products, their deceitful use of CNBC to spread fake news about themselves-- I would never invest in them because I do not want any of my money going towards their nonsense. I also think their days are numbered, as soon as wireless high-speed internet or fiber is available, people are going to switch. The technology shift and cord-cutting itself was fueled by their behavior.

In order to invest in a company, I have to believe in something about it-- that could be culture, a product, underlying value, or an industry. For example, more than a meme stock, SPCE represents a real push forward towards a worthy human endeavor (improving technology and developing industry related to space exploration and hypersonic travel). PINS is something I really enjoyed using, though I do not have a current use case for it. NET is part of why DDOS feels like it is no longer a big issue. 

I do not care about enforcing ""diversity"" through my investments-- because it is not my cause and I am not convinced that there is any real benefit. I think it may undermine the credibility of women and minorities who are on BODs. I would rather have slower, but real progress, than create a new class of token director. 

There are a million causes in the world, and I think people without a real cause or purpose gravitate towards the zeitgeist.

Do you think that investing in an ESG basket will ultimately end up being beneficial since (on paper) these companies/stocks are bound to perform well.

Aren't these companies supposed to do well in Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance aspects?

If such is the case then it is inevitable that they would generally perform well overall.

 But still , a substantial amount of a company's outlook and reputation can be linked to good governance, ethics, etc.

> South Korea is on track to set a 2050 carbon neutrality goal and end coal financing after its ruling Democratic Party won an absolute majority in the country&#039;s parliamentary elections on Wednesday.

> In its climate manifesto published last month, the Democratic Party promised to pass a &quot;Green New Deal&quot; law that would steer the country&#039;s transformation into a low-carbon economy.

> Climate Action Tracker ranked that target as &quot;Highly insufficient&quot; to meet the goal of the Paris deal to limit global warming to &quot;Well below 2C&quot;. South Korea is the world&#039;s seventh largest carbon emitter.

Pitfalls? I think the same as any other investments in a lot of ways. Specifically ESG - always make sure you are comparing apples to apples. A lot of ESG funds that sound the same are not because they are tracking different indexes, or because they have different screening criteria.  For example, some funds invest in fossil fuels but only the ""best"" fossil fuel companies etc, while some totally exclude fossil fuels. Make sure you understand what is in the fund you are buying at least enough to make you comfortable. The more ""strict"" your personal criteria is, the harder it will potentially be for you to choose one. 

Be aware of how currency and what accounts you are holding things in affects your investments. Eg. It matters whether you are holding US listed stocks in a TFSA vs RRSP vs unregistered account. Also currency exchange fees add up and may or may not be worth it to you. (This matters for me because I hold VSGX and ESGV from Vanguard in my RRSP. When i started i thought those were my best option for ESG.)  In my TFSA i am buying ESGA, XCSR, ZGB. I'm looking at adding XUSR and XDSR in future.  BMO and iShares have both brought out new offerings in the last year or so that I think are pretty comparable personally.

Tesla uses several chips inside its vehicles for different control systems and its infotainment system. Most famously, the automaker uses a chip that it designed itself for its self-driving software. 

That chip is produced by Samsung.

- Bol.com: As OP notes, this is the biggest e-commerce brand in the Netherlands and Belgium. I order from them every now and then. Their service is great and prices are often somewhat competitive. Nevertheless, Amazon is starting to become a bigger and bigger threat. At the moment the two can co-exist, but since the launch of Amazon.nl (March 2020), I believe things have started to change. 

Amazon.nl is slowly ramping up its marketing and with the emergence of Amazon‚Äôs Dutch platform, I think Bol.com should seriously start to get worried. In my experience, Amazon.nl is cheaper in about 60% of cases. Previously, Dutch people had to order from foreign Amazon platforms (e.g. Amazon.de), but this is no longer the case. 

All in all, I believe Ahold Delhaize will continue to do well in the short term. However, Bol.com should start taking Amazon.nl seriously as a competitor.

5251,1622,"> This, despite the fact that during the first quarter of the COVID crash, 94% of ESG indexes outperformed the market. 

Honestly this isn't that surprising considering which companies are more likely to get high and low ESG scores.

* Silicon Valley & tech companies tend to have more liberal minded work forces, making them more likely to implement pro-ESG policies. And tech companies have long been growing faster then non-tech companies. 

* Fossil fuel companies tend to score lower on ESG due to how damaging they are to the environment & their contributions to climate change. And guess what, despite the booming bull market in the 5 years prior to COVID, the energy sector (including all those fossil fuel companies) did horrible, and lost market share.

* Oil companies have increasingly been under attack by a campaign to effectively defund them, by getting funds to agree to not invest in them because of the harm they do the environment via climate change. If less people and funds are willing to invest in your business that will obviously lower the share price and your returns if you invest in them and more funds decide to stay away from oil, lowering the buying pressure farther. More and more oil companies have been listing this as a risk in their 10-K.

Hence ESG works for investors because it picks companies that are adapting to the future, and stays away from entire industries that are in long drawn out free falls due to changing technology & stricter environmental regulations.

5315,1699,"While it's definitely a valid point to show how the different shops behave and what their costs are, there are a couple things I'd like to add here because it's important to understand how businesses come to the conclusions they do.  

Authorized shops pay more for that authorized label, which in turn reflects back on the manufacturer's brand.  The manufacturer is selling their credibility in exchange for ensuring certain processes are followed for reliability, and those excess costs get passed on to the consumer.

As well, most shops are loathe to install customer-provided parts because there's a lot of additional risk in doing so.  For instance, if the drive fails a month later who is responsible for that?  Was it the part that failed, or was it due to shoddy workmanship?  What if the failure isn't explicit and is instead smaller behavior issues? Do enough work with end consumers and you'll know that many people will do whatever they can to save a dime.   ""Here's my new 1TB M.2 SSD that I got from a sketchy Chinese auction site!"" is followed up with the inevitable ""Hey, this thing only storing up to 120GB, you clearly broke it when you installed it and I want my money back!"" which is further time and effort expended in the name of dealing with a customer you voluntarily entered into a business arrangement with - if left unhappy, many customers will turn around and publicly trash your company and cost you further business even if you were explicit in what your workmanship entailed.

It's great if you can find a mom & pop shop that is reliable, but the problem is finding those reliable shops.  Independent retailers all have different ideas on how business should be conducted, and like penny-pinching customers there are penny-pinching businesses as well.  What if they're saving money by not having ESD protection in their shop?  The part failed - was it due to a bad part or their shoddy workmanship?  How do you know they're actually competent at what they do and not just letting their 13 year old nephew do the installation?  What is your recourse if they damage your equipment and deny responsibility?

And of course their $60 charge for 10 minutes of work seems expensive, but you're not paying just for 10 minutes of work.  You're paying for the rent for the shop to be there day in and day out.  You're paying for the managers who schedule the techs, you're paying for the unemployment insurance, you're paying for the costs of their electricity and water so they can run in a habitable space, you're paying for accounting work to make sure the books are balanced every month, you're paying for the risks the owner started in opening their own shop, and you're paying for the technician to be available when you decide on a Tuesday morning that you want your computer upgraded right then.  The shop has decided it costs a minimum of $60 per customer just to cover their own costs and ensure some profit at the end of the day.

It's all a balancing act of various interests.  If you want a shop that you know is backstopped by a global manufacturer in regards to quality of workmanship, you pay more for that knowledge so they can be trained and certified.  They're not paid to take risks, and the fact that they have to turn away some business to maintain certain standards means that they're going to charge you more for their work as well.  If you want a shop that can save you money, you're still paying to ensure all of their overhead is covered because you're still choosing them as a source of knowledge and expertise that you yourself lack.",definitely valid point show different shop behave cost be couple thing i d like add important understand business come conclusion do authorize shop pay authorize label turn reflect back manufacturer brand manufacturer sell credibility exchange ensure certain process follow reliability excess cost get pass consumer well shop loathe install customerprovide part there s lot additional risk so instance drive fail month later responsible that part fail due shoddy workmanship failure explicit instead small behavior issue enough work end consumer know many people whatever save dime here new 1 tb m2 ssd get sketchy chinese auction site follow inevitable hey thing store 120 gb clearly break instal want money back time effort expend name deal customer voluntarily enter business arrangement leave unhappy many customer turn around publicly trash company cost business even explicit workmanship entail great find mom pop shop reliable problem find reliable shop independent retailer different idea business conduct like pennypinche customer pennypinche business well they re save money esd protection shop part fail due bad part shoddy workmanship know they re actually competent let 13 year old nephew installation recourse damage equipment deny responsibility course 60 charge 10 minute work seem expensive pay 10 minute work pay rent shop day day out pay manager schedule tech pay unemployment insurance pay cost electricity water run habitable space pay accounting work make sure book balance every month pay risk owner start open shop pay technician available decide tuesday morning want computer upgrade right then shop decide cost minimum 60 per customer cover cost ensure profit end day balancing act various interest want shop know backstoppe global manufacturer regard quality workmanship pay knowledge train certify they re pay take risk fact turn away business maintain certain standard mean they re go charge work well want shop save money still pay ensure overhead cover still choose source knowledge expertise lack,308,-0.5333333333333333,0.09740259740259741,2020-09-15 18:55:56,-1,esg-bearish

I would add for any skeptic on the bull uranium thesis, the lead time to building a mine can range, from the DFS to actual first ore mined, between 2 years to 6 years depending on factors such as open-pit versus underground, infrastructure access, ISR versus traditional mining. Even if we assume all mine restart now, the ones in care and maintenance, and even add BHP's Olympic dam expansion, we will arrive in 2028, the year at which cigar lake will end production, with a massive deficit in supply.

For the environmentally conscious investor (no fossil fuels, no tobacco, save the world types) I would suggest government bonds, green energy stocks, stocks in grocery stores, Money Market Funds, stocks in communications companies, and lending through kiva, SoLo, and using banks like Aspiration, a local credit union, stocks in funeral homes for the long term, and organic food companies, with municipal bonds, and CDs.

&#x200B;

For the religiously conscious investor (considers interest as usury, debt is slavery, doesn't want to invest in companies that make money from immoral media, no alcohol companies, etc.) I would suggest primarily investing in stocks of fossil fuel companies, mining, electronics companies, communications companies, etc. I would suggest staying away from any and all forms of debt so CDs, Bonds, Treasury Notes, etc are all out of the picture. Investing in companies that have a good track record of donating to charities like Target would be a good place to start, and looking into video game companies, and book publishers that don't publish pornography would be a good place to start.

&#x200B;

With any socially responsible investor I would suggest that you stay away from ETFs, and make a list of absolute no-nos, and a list of a few issues that you are not too avid about, but would be nice if the companies you invest in didn't produce or be involved in.

5345,1735,"I feel like this pitch is going to get a lot more oomph if someone can draw a clearer line between sustainable businesses and why exactly they outperform during a crisis.

Sort of the way the power issue is being decided: the explosion in renewables is *not* due to everyone seeing the light of greenhouse gas emissions; instead it is because in many places it is now cheaper and more reliable than combustion methods.

Which is to say, if there was no information about climate available at all, it would still be the *strategically superior option*.

My bet for why businesses that pay attention to sustainability outperform *especially during downturns* is that they are effectively mitigating risks that are routinely ignored by ones that focus exclusively on the shareholder value model. But to make the change, we need to identify and quantify what specific risks those are.

That would also let the insurance industry march to the same drumbeat: I bet if funds say ""do X, Y and Z to slightly boost your share price"" and insurance companies say ""do X, Y and Z to slightly reduce your insurance costs"" then the middle-of-the-road regular business will just go ahead and do it.",feel like pitch go get lot oomph someone draw clear line sustainable business exactly outperform crisis sort way power issue decide explosion renewable not due everyone see light greenhouse gas emission instead many place cheaper reliable combustion method say information climate available all would still strategically superior option bet business pay attention sustainability outperform especially downturn effectively mitigate risk routinely ignore one focus exclusively shareholder value model make change need identify quantify specific risk be would also let insurance industry march drumbeat bet fund say do x z slightly boost share price insurance company say do x z slightly reduce insurance cost middleoftheroad regular business go ahead it,108,0.08333333333333333,0.2222222222222222,2021-01-26 21:50:43,1,esg-bullish

5452,1869,"Reading articles including Arbonne, they typically show a lack of understanding of how the system actually works.

One. You have to actually do the fucking work, just like any other business. 

20% of small businesses fail in their first year, 30% fail in the first two years, and 50% of them fail in the first five years.

Failure means money lost. Losing money isn't something that only happens in social marketing businesses.

Two. ""Buying stock"" isn't a normal or recommended situation. Having products you personally use, for the purposes of actually understanding what you're marketing, and actually getting value yourself, is the normal. All orders are through an online shop... you never sell stock out of your own cabinet. Giving away samples? Sure. But orders are done externally to you, you don't have to float the product. Ever. People order from an online shop, and you receive commission for creating that bridge. It's hands off, for the people who already know what they want.

Three. No income is made on the recruitment of consultants alone. Those consultants must sell products themselves, meaning people are purchasing products they enjoy or find value in, for their upline to make any extra income from people below them... people who are also recieving commission.

You guys can have whatever opinions you please.

My truth? My wife made an extra 14,000 dollars in her first 11 months of running an Arbonne side-hustle, with consistent growth. This is in addition to our main business, which charges $75/hr for coaching, $1,500/month for horse development, and grossed over 90k last year. She has long struggled with major skin problems, and inflammation... not anymore. Her mother lost 80 pounds in the last year, and is in the best shape since she was 25. A horsemanship client lost 75 pounds in the last 4 months, and is equally ecstatic about how much better she feels. A long list of people truly enjoy, and get value out of, a myriad of products that they use everyday.... and the only stock we have on hand is stuff that WE use everyday.

Oh, and all the consultants below her... who are actually doing the work... are paying their bills with the business, and doing it alongside what they were already doing. She doesn't waste time with those not willing to do the work.

It's almost like that long list of people not making any income, are people that suck at business, and signed up for ""easy money,"" when there is no such thing, in any business.

5493,1924,">So, yesterday I created a little discussion in /r/stocks which got me hung, drawn and downvoted, called a ""fucking sociopath"", and framed as a sexist and racist prick.

I think you are exaggerating this a bit. I only saw one comment where you got massively downvoted and lots of people did honestly reply to your post overall.

The one time I did see you catch the major downvotes was because someone pointed out that your overall question is about ethical investing but one of the examples you gave for it was investing in a company just because it has a women CEO, which on it's face isn't ethical or unethical but rather pretty dumb and a bit sexist. You then tried to pivot and argue it falls under personal preference, but that has nothing to do with your original question of ethical investing which is why you were rightfully downvoted in that one instance.

Anyway, answering your actual question, no I don't participate in ethical investing as almost all of my holdings are in broad index funds so I have lots of companies who's overall mission statement/business practices I don't agree with. I'm not particularly happy about that but there's not a good way for me to achieve low cost diversification without it.",so yesterday create little discussion rstock got hung draw downvoted call fucking sociopath frame sexist racist prick think exaggerate bit see one comment get massively downvote lot people honestly reply post overall one time see catch major downvote someone point overall question ethical investing one example give invest company woman ceo face ethical unethical rather pretty dumb bit sexist try pivot argue fall personal preference nothing original question ethical investing rightfully downvote one instance anyway answer actual question participate ethical investing almost holding broad index fund lot company who s overall mission statementbusiness practice agree with I m particularly happy there s good way achieve low cost diversification without it,110,-0.3333333333333333,0.10909090909090909,2020-01-23 14:38:49,-1,esg-bearish

* The data is cherry picked. The article doesn't refer to social or impact investing in general but, instead, to one specific index: the MSCK KLD 400. For instance, MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital Investing) runs a bunch of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) special interest indexes and many of them have underperformed the market.
* The data is approximate. Ownership of the index has changed hands several times over the years and the measurement criteria have been inconsistent, making backward looking results a best guess. According to Morgan Stanley, ""*...the former KLD indexes had multiple third party index calculators over time. Consequently the MSCI ESG index histories have been aggregated and compiled to create a continuous time series from a variety of sources‚Äîsources which may have followed different index calculation methodologies in some instances.*""
* The data ignores transaction costs. The returns do not take trading costs into account and the MSCI KLD 400 has a lot higher velocity than the S&P 500. During the 12 months ending in April 2015, the MSCI KLD 400 had a turnover of 12.55%. 

There's nothing intrinsically wrong with social or impact investing but it is axiomatic in the investment community that beating the S&P 500 is what marks the difference between success and failure of a managed portfolio. If you compare bottom line results net of costs, investing in the [MSCI KLD 400](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-kld-400-social-index.pdf) would have underperformed the relatively mindless S&P 500 index not to mention the MSCI USA index.

The appropriate comparison for impact investing, she said, is not to the entire global capital market, but to the pittance that now goes to foreign aid and economic development. A one percent shift in asset allocation toward sustainable development would generate $2 trillion, she said, 10-times the global budget for foreign aid

...and avoid getting defense about it as some kind of challenge to capitalism as we know it...

5551,2007,"**Most of what I'm about to say is either explained in** [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weVAN2HxXjk) **or sourced in the description. The rest is sourced directly via links in the text. Please watch the video first, as it is necessary context for this post.**

ESG investing yields lower returns compared to non-ESG funds in the same sectors and exposed to the same factors (like small cap, growth, etc.) This is theoretically justified and historically evident. The reasons have nuance but let me put it simply: When a large (but not unanimous) portion of the market is receiving a consumptive good benefit (i.e., you are getting a social, personal, or psychological reward) for investing in a certain kind of asset, or excluding a certain kind of asset, then the price of that asset will be higher than a comparable asset that carries no such benefit. This means you overpay and have lower expected future returns. The inverse is also true: If you pay a non-financial cost for investing in a certain asset, you will underbuy that asset, and thus it will be cheaper. Think about the social, psychological, or reputational costs you might incur for telling your friends, neighbors, teachers, or political allies that you invest in private prison companies. When this dynamic is at play for some, but not all of the market, the portion of the market that is doing the ""ESG investing"" is by definition expecting lower future returns. This fact is unavoidable from an economic lens, and has been confirmed empirically.

Felix in the video also goes into more depth about other adjacent reasons that this must hold. One is the fact that there is, of course, a level of return differential between ESG and non-ESG investing that would cause even the most fervent ESG investors to stop ESG investing, and this fact alone means that non-ESG investing has a higher expected return. Also, the MORE people invest in ESG, the LOWER the expected return for someone buying in or holding those assets becomes. Some people are tempted to think to themselves, ""I'll buy ESG funds in the hopes that in the future, more people than ever buy ESG funds"" but this is an explicit greater-fool theory of investing that -never works for the majority who participate in it, by definition.- With 25% of US stock money being in ESG funds (and 50% of Canadian $!), who is really the fool? When the top suggested ETFs by the entire internet tend to be explicit ESG plays like clean energy ETFs and ARK funds, where are you on the fool continuum for buying or holding those assets? Greater-fool speculative market timing doesn't work, but what you can be sure of, in this circumstance, is that you are buying overpriced equities that will depress future returns when things return to their fundamentals...this is a logically necessary, unavoidable implication if fund flows are determining price increases!

One might point out, ""but look how good X industry has done! Clean energy has outperformed fossil fuels!"" This is a tempting response, but the researchers aren't stupid. Certain factors are always outperforming other factors, and in this case, growth companies and tech companies have been on an incredible run. The authors -already control- for sector, size, momentum, value/growth, investment, profitability, and so on. When you control for all of that, then look specifically at the differences between two batches of companies that are equivalent in every financially relevant way, but one has ESG designations and one doesn't, the ESG underperforms. ESG funds are indeed in sectors and factors that have outperformed, but they UNDERPERFORMED relative to non-ESG holdings in those same sectors and factors. ESG-ness itself turns out to be a net harm to returns both in theory and in practice.

The other aspects of the costs of ESG investing are even simpler and surely unlikely to be doubted, but I'll quickly say them again. The fees of ESG funds are higher than the fees of other diversified market-weight index funds and targeted factor funds. The turnover is higher as well. Also, the difference in diversification is obvious...a subset of the market is never as diversified as the entire market. To remind people of the benefit of diversification: When you lower your diversification substantially, you raise your risk, raise your volatility, and increase uncertainty about future returns...and, crucially, lowering diversification does not increase your expected future returns. William F. Sharpe won a Nobel Prize in part for proving that you do not get paid for taking more risk when the risk can be diversified away. So not only does lowering diversification not increase future returns, in the case of ESG, it reduces your future returns as well.

Another aspect of ESG investing not covered in the video but more than worth mentioning, is that ESG stocks tend to be in the category of stocks that have the -lowest historical and expected returns of the entire market-. The authors of the study control this away in order to isolate ESG-ness, but let me also share the factor information of the companies you are buying into. These companies tend to be growth stocks, almost all of them are unprofitable, and they are biased toward being small, and they exhibit high positive skewness (they have a higher-than-normal chance to have massive returns). Small cap, unprofitable growth stocks are the [Black Hole of Investing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avoid-the-black-hole-of-investing/). From the [Lottery Ticket Effect](https://www.etf.com/sections/index-investor-corner/swedroe-investors-prefer-gambling-stocks?nopaging=1) where investors consistently overpay for stocks that have a higher chance of massive short term returns, leading to lower total average returns, to the fact that [they have liquidity problems and are difficult to short](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedroe-rediscovering-size-effect-233000204.html), leading to prices being set systematically higher than they should because the market is unable to knock them down, ESG investing biases toward market segments that are are bad, bad, bad, and bad. Not to mention, [""technological revolution"" investing tends to be a loser's game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k), with prices being very prone to bubble behavior and consistent overpricing and lower returns relative to declining industries. I'll say it again, recent massive overperformance of ESG industries/factors is not a counterargument here...it is just further reason to believe that you are not getting a deal or buying/holding underpriced stocks.

ESG investing is the -opposite- of a free lunch. It harms your portfolio in just about every way that a portfolio can be harmed. If more people interested in ESG investing knew this, I suspect they may think twice about whether they are willing to sacrifice so much [for so little, if any positive impact on the world.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18136214/impact-investing-socially-responsible-sri-report) Consider keeping your portfolio invested rationally, with low cost total market indexes, potentially biased toward higher expected return assets in the market, like small cap value (AVUV, SLYV, AVDV) or emerging market stocks (VWO,AVEM), and then simply donating the money you can afford to the objectively most cost effective charities in the world, such as those identified by [https://www.givewell.org/](https://www.givewell.org/) and [https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) .

5589,2060,"This is great info but I‚Äôve been doing this a *LONG* time and seen tons of investment fads come and go. Hate to say it, but ESG is just another one. 

People forget this even though it should be obvious, but all hedge funds/mutual funds/PE firms/VC firms have short/medium/long term marketing plans. There are marketing and business development people whose job it is to take the temperature of the world and make sure the firm is positioned properly. 

For example, for the last ~5 years, *everything* is ‚Äòquant‚Äô-this and ‚Äòquant‚Äô-that. Did funds *really* change their strats? Fuck no. What they did was pay some data aggregator $1M for data access and hire some guy with a MS in statistics to crunch data, *and then went back to doing what they were already doing.* The stat guys job is to provide a ‚Äòquant‚Äô rationale for a decision after the fact. Occasionally, they *might* add some a priori ideas to the ‚Äòinvestment mix‚Äô. 

I‚Äôm saying this bc I‚Äôve worked buyside structures credit for over 10 years are we are *very* quant focused (yeah, I was a quant before it was cool) - but my peers and I laugh at what other firms try to get away with under the guise of ‚Äòquant driven‚Äô.

Now to ESG - we have a great marketing/BD teams and we are already trying to figure out how to pitch our funds as having an ESG focus without changing our process. For example, I‚Äôm already into an energy credit trade - fossil fuels are the opposite of ‚ÄòESG‚Äô, right? So I‚Äôll have a junior go find me a way to frame the trade. The credit we bought comes from an oil company that invests a tiny bit in renewables? Perfect! ‚ÄúWe chose this credit for both the risk oppy AND due to our commitment to supporting companies the focuses on ESG.‚Äù In reality I didn‚Äôt change shit. This was the same with ‚Äòquant‚Äô, ‚Äòwoman focused‚Äô, ‚ÄòCorp governance‚Äô, ‚ÄòCorp social responsibility‚Äô etc.

5601,2077,"There seems to be interest by members of this subreddit to discuss / learn more about impact investing, so here is a thread for us to talk about it and where I can share as much information as possible.

**MY BACKGROUND:** 5+ years of private equity / private debt theme-based impact investing with a focus on climate change, the circular economy and sustainable cities & communities. I work closely with the UN on financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) which recently recognised me as one of 50+ industry leaders worldwide. I am NOT a public markets expert, nor do I know absolutely everything about impact investing. This industry is fast moving, and I learn something new everyday.

**PRIMER:** The image that I linked to this post is the responsible investing spectrum. I‚Äôve found it to be a very good primer when discussing impact investing and how it positions itself versus other types of investments. To summarize the spectrum in plain English:

* **Traditional investing**: Does not take into account Environmental, Social or Governance (ESG) considerations when making an investment decision. These types of investors only focus on financial returns.
* **Responsible investing**: These investors take into account ESG in their risk mitigation strategy. Roughly 25% (roughly $20 Trillion) of all professionally managed assets around the world take into account ESG when making an investment decision (i.e the orange ‚ÄúESG risk management‚Äù bar on the image). Based on existing commitments, it is expected that this percentage will rise to roughly 75% of assets under management (AUM) by 2030 (NEED TO ADD CITATION)

[https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/the-rise-of-responsible-investment-fs.html](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/the-rise-of-responsible-investment-fs.html)

* **Sustainable / socially responsible investing:** These types of investors don‚Äôt just see ESG issues as a risk to mitigate, but they believe that ESG can create opportunities for the companies.
* **Impact Investing:** Impact investing is defined as ‚ÄúImpact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return‚Äù. Impact investing can be split into two categories depending on the financial returns targeted:

o **Theme based impact investing** (this is what I do)**:** These types of investors seek market rate returns alongside the positive impact generated by their investments.

o **Impact First investing:** These investors are willing to sacrifice some financial return in the hopes of generating more impact; basically have a higher impact per dollar.

* **Philanthropy:** These investors either seek capital preservation (no returns) or offer grants and loss capital (negative returns). I know it looks really weird to put philanthropy on an investment spectrum, and in most cases I would not consider what they do as investing, however when it comes to impact investing these people often play a key role in **blended finance** investments. In these types of investments, the philanthropic capital provide a first loss guarantee / transfer their pro rata returns to other investors; thus derisking the investment opportunity for other investors and catalysing more capital to address the social, economic or environmental issue that they are trying to address.

**KEY FACTS & FIGURES:**

A lot of the information here comes from various studies published by the GIIN, you can find them here : [https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/](https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/)

\- Size of the market: $502 Billion in 2018. It is expected that the global impact investing market has reached $1 Trillion in 2019

\- About two-thirds of investors seek market-rate returns (66%), and the remaining third are split between those targeting returns closer to market rate (19%) and those targeting returns closer to capital preservation (15%).

As a side note, the vast majority (roughly 90%) of studies show that investments that incorporate ESG analysis outperform non-ESG investments in the long term. This is probably why such a large portion of the financial industry is switching over to ESG strategies.

[https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/195919/esg-funds-beat-non-sustainable-sister-funds.aspx](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/195919/esg-funds-beat-non-sustainable-sister-funds.aspx)

**COMMON QUESTIONS / COMMENTS:**

**What is the difference between a strong ESG company and an impact company?** For an impact company the impact scales with the size of the business (i.e impact generation IS the business plan), whereas for an ESG company that relationship does not necessarily hold true. For example, Coca cola scores quite well in ESG issues thanks to their sustainable supply chains, good governance etc. but at the end of the day their core business is drinks to people, so selling more doesn\`t automatically mean they are generating more impact. A renewable energy company however generates impact from its core operations.

**Is impact investing in public markets possible?** Historically impact investing has been private investments (debt and equity) since investors have much more control over the company‚Äôs impact generation. In my personal opinion, the majority of impact investing in public markets is baloney since investment managers follow a top down investment approach of successive screening. The best (and hardest) way to do impact investing in public markets is bottom up where you go from impact themes, look for companies that operate in those themes, identify the tope performing ones and invest. The best example I have found on the market of this is the Wellington Asset Management Impact strategy.

[https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm\_referrer=https://www.google.ca/](https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm_referrer=https://www.google.ca/)

**Does impact investing actually generate the expected returns?** The link below is an oldy but goody (2017 with 2016 data). But long story short, yes the financial returns of impact investments are in line with their non impact peers for both market rate & below market rate investment strategies.

[https://thegiin.org/assets/2017\_GIIN\_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments\_Web.pdf](https://thegiin.org/assets/2017_GIIN_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments_Web.pdf)

**Given it's a subset of the market, why do you think you are finding similar risk adjusted returns? Is it primarily due to government subsidy?**  For non-blended investments, I would argue that there are a few things driving returns:

\- More information = better investment decision making : when you're looking at a company / fund from an impact perspective, you're asking a lot more detailed questions about the business and you're getting much more familiar with the market.

\- Different investment opportunities : when you have a bottom up approach where you start from the problem you want to address then look for companies / solutions in that space, you find investment opportunities & strategies that nobody else / very few people have thought of. Given the glut of capital in the markets right now looking for investable opportunities, having fewer people around the table allows to to make better deals.

**This is a whole load of impact-washing / green-washing baloney:**  This is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and the reason why organisations like the GIIN, UN etc. are working so hard to have proper industry standards for impact measurement, management and communication. A lot of progress has been made over the past year however with the launch of IRIS+ by the GIIN and the SDG certification framework by the UN.

5609,2090,"All of this isn't necessary. It would be far less effective than what we have now.

You discuss environmental concerns.  I'll come to those later.  First, let's talk about efficiency. You mention the energy generation industry. Now, the experts in energy are generally people working in that industry already. The energy generation industry will pay the highest wages for such experts. No committee of generalists - no matter how talented - is likely to perform better than the experts already within an industry. In addition, many parts of the energy industry are competitive. Oil extraction, for example, is very competitive. In many developed countries there are markets for electricity which are also competitive. This means that the most competent organizations succeed, and that the best ideas succeed. Let's say that the R&D department of an electricity company comes up with an optimization for it's power stations. If the optimization works then the business they work for will make greater profits. The procedure will then be copied by others. There is no need for any central committee of generalists to be convinced before anything can happen. Different businesses can experiments and takes different paths. Those that make the best decisions will make the most profit.

The markets also respond quickly to changes in conditions. Far quicker than a large organization could. Producers can choose what inputs then use and vary them over time. If the price of an input rises then other inputs can be used as a substitute. Take the electricity pool markets, for example. When there are high winds the price of wind power falls, so more of it is bought. Other electricity producers then decrease their own output. A more long-term example is the car market. Car bodywork can be made of steel, aluminium or glass-fibre. When the price of one material falls it makes that material more attractive to car makers. It doesn't matter to the car makers exactly why the material changes in price. That's a matter for the makers of those materials. Those further up the chain only see the price change. In this way prices signal scarcity. If a price rises it means that the quantity supplied has fallen or that the quantity demanded has risen. In either case it is efficient to reduce the consumption of that good. The price rise encourages that reduction. So, there is no real reason to change from what we have now.

The exception to all this is environment issues. Producers often create emissions which are costs for other people. For example, coal fired power stations produce carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Farmers using fertilizer and pesticides create run-off. Aerosol cans used to create CFC emissions. All of these things are not priced into the cost of the corresponding activities. However, central organization is not the best way to solve this problem. We can preserve the beneficial effects of markets. One way to do this is to tax these emissions. This tax is designed to capture the cost of the activity to other parties. This is why many countries have carbon taxes or systems of credits for pollution (""cap-and-trade""). For other pollutants outright bans are more appropriate.",necessary would far less effective now discuss environmental concern ill come later first let talk efficiency mention energy generation industry now expert energy generally people work industry already energy generation industry pay high wage expert committee generalist matter talente likely perform well expert already within industry addition many part energy industry competitive oil extraction example competitive many develop country market electricity also competitive mean competent organization succeed good idea succeed let say rd department electricity company come optimization power station optimization work business work make great profit procedure copy other need central committee generalist convince anything happen different business experiment take different path make good decision make profit market also respond quickly change condition far quick large organization could producer choose input use vary time price input rise input use substitute take electricity pool market example high wind price wind power fall buy electricity producer decrease output longterm example car market car bodywork make steel aluminium glassfibre price one material fall make material attractive car maker matter car maker exactly material change price that s matter maker material chain see price change way price signal scarcity price rise mean quantity supply fallen quantity demand rise either case efficient reduce consumption good price rise encourage reduction so real reason change now exception environment issue producer often create emission cost people example coal fire power station produce carbon dioxide sulphur dioxide farmer use fertilizer pesticide create runoff aerosol can use create cfc emission thing price cost correspond activity however central organization good way solve problem preserve beneficial effect market one way tax emission tax design capture cost activity party many country carbon taxis system credit pollution capandtrade pollutant outright ban appropriate,279,0.1724137931034483,0.1039426523297491,2019-08-14 16:57:46,1,esg-bullish

As customers, governments, and employees recognize this fact, corporations are competing to get ahead of the expected change in regulations / preferences. Those who are ahead are seeing higher profits.

5649,2148,"Cheap talk obviously amounts to very little, but we shouldn't discount strategies that could exercise real leverage over corporate behavior. 

For instance, while impact investing (e.g. investment funds targeted at socially beneficial outcomes, like an ETF that only invests in green tech) is small, if it expands it will increase the relative availability of capital for environmentally sustainable companies. 

There may also be ways in which large institutional investors may start to incorporate social ills into their bottom line. Take a company like Blackrock which holds shares widely distributed through the S&P 500. They hold shares in many oil companies that would profit while emitting CO2, but also many insurance companies that could lose a fortune if climate-related disasters increased. 

For what it's worth, simply by being a passive investor in index funds, I've been able to vote on fund policies (e.g. there was a proposal on whether or not to invest in companies complicit in genocide).

5825,2428,"To give a concrete answer to this you need to more specifically what sustainable means--it needs to be translated into an actionable definition upon which one can invest.

A variety of indexes have been established to enable passive investing along sustainable lines. So if by sustainable you mean carbon-weighted, to invest in companies the produce fewer carbon emissions, that exists.  There are also ETFs that track the clean tech, alternative energy, and solar sectors.  Other ETFs use slightly more subjective ESG screens, which include an environmental component.  You can also buy an ETN that invests in carbon credits.  

This is an ok list of available products: http://wire.kapitall.com/investment-idea/a-list-of-green-etfs-for-responsible-investing/

Finally, and perhaps most usefully, a variety of index companies (S&P, FTSE, MSCI) have applied simple carbon weightings to major global indices.  I think this is the way to go, as it deviates minimially from major indicies in which you should invest, except for the companies' carbon risk.  For example, http://www.ftse.com/Indices/FTSE_CDP_Carbon_Strategy_Index_Series/  Forward-looking pensions are implementing these strategies, however I have not found any good products for retail investors that replicate these strategies.

5858,2484," Mr. Speaker, 

I come once again to comment on this bill. In the last reading, I expressed both a fundamental doubt regarding the concept of the bill and also an amendable, resolvable doubt about the language of it. I am sorry to say that neither have been assuaged.

With regards to the fundamental doubt, this would have to be the idea of restraining investment opportunities to start with. I am inclined to believe that the main goal of these funds should be to increase the rate of return on investment, as this benefits all of us as the public. We depend on these funds, workers depend on these funds. Yet, if they do not maximise returns, then it seems to me that they will become less efficient and harm all who depend on them. Furthermore, it also creates the chance of accruing losses over time as the funds become more emburdened by stringent guidelines and restraining rules. This should be an unacceptable risk to take in my opinion, since the costs could be large. However, when my Friend posed a question regarding these costs to the Deputy Prime Minister, instead of giving a clear, honest answer, he dodged it completely. This action did no favours in convincing me that this government neither knows what it is even doing with this bill nor has an understanding of the tangible consequences of it upon our country‚Äôs various funds. So on this count, I will oppose this bill. As an idea, perhaps it would be better to try and stamp out the undesirable activities directly through international and domestic rules and systems instead of relying on restraining and weakening our own crucial funds. I would see this method as one which reconciles all desires here, but it is one that this government has not opted to take.

Mr. Speaker, I also remember this bill as being generally imprecise with language and incorrect in application. Indeed, there is a significant, systematic  issue within the bill when the term ‚Äòethical‚Äô is bandied about but no definition or clarification is added specifying it. So, in committee I did what I saw was my obligation in the face of almost certain passage of this bill by the government‚Äîno matter how poorly written the final product would be. I put forth multiple amendments which based the language of this bill on more solid foundations and real documents. Using this approach I believed, and still do believe, it made a better piece of legislation in the end because less of the bill‚Äôs application would be informed by some highly amorphous concept of ethics from each person who enforces this bill. People who manage our funds should have firm standards set into law simply because without guidelines, management of these critical funds will become more arbitrary and less predictable. Stability and consistent standards are essential for the sound management of critical state funds, and I had thought that this was an argument that all would have come to accept. Indeed, with these amendments any vote in favour would not have violated the coalition agreement nor would it have softened this bill. Yet, these amendments, save the one to Schedule 1, failed to pass and this also serves as a reason to oppose this bill. We cannot tolerate the imprecise language here since it could create unacceptable costs in the same vein as those derived from the restrictions to begin with. While I celebrate the acceptance of the amendment to Schedule 1, an amendment which fixes many of the bill‚Äôs flaws, it does not go far enough in rectifying the bill‚Äôs problems with vagueness. On this count, too, I will oppose this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I will vote against this bill unfortunately. I had hoped to be able to support it for the final reading but it will not be possible due to the failure to resolve serious doubts and preventable errors. I encourage my fellow MPs to do the same.",mr speaker come comment bill last reading express fundamental doubt regard concept bill also amendable resolvable doubt language it sorry say neither assuage regard fundamental doubt would idea restrain investment opportunity start with inclined believe main goal fund increase rate return investment benefit we public depend fund worker depend fund yet maximise return seem become less efficient harm depend they furthermore also create chance accrue loss time fund become emburdened stringent guideline restrain rule unacceptable risk take opinion since cost could large however friend pose question regard cost deputy prime minister instead give clear honest answer dodge completely action favour convince government neither know even bill understand tangible consequence upon countrys various fund count oppose bill idea perhaps would well try stamp undesirable activity directly international domestic rule system instead rely restrain weaken crucial fund would see method one reconcile desire here one government opt take mr speaker also remember bill generally imprecise language incorrect application indeed significant systematic issue within bill term ethical bandied definition clarification add specify it so committee see obligation face almost certain passage bill governmentno matter poorly write final product would be put forth multiple amendment base language bill solid foundation real document use approach believe still believe make well piece legislation end less bill application would inform highly amorphous concept ethic person enforce bill people manage fund firm standard set law simply without guideline management critical fund become arbitrary less predictable stability consistent standard essential sound management critical state fund think argument would come accept indeed amendment vote favour would violate coalition agreement would soften bill yet amendment save one schedule 1 fail pass also serve reason oppose bill can not tolerate imprecise language since could create unacceptable cost vein derive restriction begin with celebrate acceptance amendment schedule 1 amendment fix many bill flaw go far enough rectifying bill problem vagueness count too oppose bill mr speaker vote bill unfortunately hope able support final reading possible due failure resolve serious doubt preventable error encourage fellow mp same,333,-0.6338028169014085,0.2132132132132132,2019-01-10 04:43:40,-1,esg-bearish

5868,2501,"Kia ora, Mr Speaker. NgƒÅ mihi nui ki a koutou, kia ora.

Mr Speaker, I rise again in strong support of this bill. This bill is about ensuring that our Crown investment agencies don't try to profit off of pain, misery, and suffering. This bill is about ensuring that ethical investment criteria is set in law, not just reliant on whether or not the current Superannuation fund guardians believe it's a good idea or not. It's also about streamlining this minimum criteria across all our Crown investment agencies.

Up and down New Zealand, we are seeing consumers place more and more value on ethical conduct and sustainability. Companies are forced to take positive steps to reducing their environmental impact, people care more about purchasing fair trade products, and the like. People care about the impact their money has on the world around them. Our Crown investment agencies must be receptive to that demand as they invest taxpayer money, and use our money wisely on the international market, as consumers do at the supermarket. We owe it to consumers to make the obligations of our Crown investment agencies crystal clear in our statute books

We cannot bandy around our ""100% pure NZ"" slogan whilst investing in companies that actively destroy the environment. I know the National Party wants to have their cake and eat it too, but we can't pretend to be environmental leaders by investing in environmental destruction. We can't pretend to be responsible global citizens whilst financing the global arms trade. We can't be a nuclear-free nation if we invest in companies that produce nuclear weapons. It's this two hats mentality, that it's out of sight and out of mind, which we must reject.

We must move from a passive position on ethics and sustainability and take a more active role. The opposition is scared of putting our money where out mouth is as a nation, and that doesn't surprise anyone. This is a courageous step forward, marking the interests of New Zealand loud and clear on the world stage.

I must note it's quite ironic to hear National members accuse this government of trying to 'railroad through' legislation, considering the last government's abuses of urgency, rushing through unpopular legislation at the last minute without any chance for public oversight. No, this government still stands for transparency and accountability, following through with the appropriate parliamentary procedure, and most importantly, listening to voters. Perhaps that explains why they're in opposition.

Nevertheless, I commend this principled and forward-thinking bill to the house, a bill that prioritises New Zealand's interests as an ethical and sustainability-focussed nation, soundly rejecting the opposition's penchant for environmental destruction.",kia ora mr speaker ngƒÅ mihi nui ki koutou kia ora mr speaker rise strong support bill bill ensure crown investment agency try profit pain misery suffering bill ensure ethical investment criterion set law reliant whether current superannuation fund guardian believe good idea not also streamline minimum criterion across crown investment agency new zealand see consumer place value ethical conduct sustainability company force take positive step reduce environmental impact people care purchase fair trade product like people care impact money world around they crown investment agency must receptive demand invest taxpayer money use money wisely international market consumer supermarket owe consumer make obligation crown investment agency crystal clear statute book can not bandy around 100 pure nz slogan whilst invest company actively destroy environment know national party want cake eat too ca nt pretend environmental leader invest environmental destruction ca nt pretend responsible global citizen whilst finance global arm trade ca nt nuclearfree nation invest company produce nuclear weapon two hat mentality sight mind must reject must move passive position ethic sustainability take active role opposition scare put money mouth nation surprise anyone courageous step forward mark interest new zealand loud clear world stage must note quite ironic hear national member accuse government try railroad through legislation consider last government abuse urgency rush unpopular legislation last minute without chance public oversight no government still stand transparency accountability follow appropriate parliamentary procedure importantly listen voter perhaps explain they re opposition nevertheless commend principle forwardthinking bill house bill prioritise new zealand interest ethical sustainabilityfocussed nation soundly reject opposition penchant environmental destruction,259,-0.35,0.15444015444015444,2019-01-10 12:02:35,-1,esg-bearish

5888,2535,"Deputy Speaker,

This Bill is riddled with issues - it does not define what is ethical, nor does it establish any body to adjudicate on this issue, or make it judicially reviewable.

It‚Äôs puerile attempts to quantify areas where a ban on investment includes ‚Äúthe sale of nuclear weapons contrary to international law‚Äù. As far as I‚Äôm aware, the sovereign wealth fund does not invest in companies will produce or sell nuclear weapons. It also seeks to ban investment in illegal activities - forgive me for asking, but does the Minister think these illegal poachers or lumber mills are floating stocks on the markets? Does he believe that these immoral groups release their cash flow and operating revenue before going into Cambodia to cut down trees?

What‚Äôs more - the bill seeks to propose a ban on gold and oil extraction which involves ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù environmental damage - will the Minister be founding a body to adjudicate on these issues?

Again on this issue - why is investment in the extraction of gold to be banned if it is ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù, but not other minerals such as silver, zinc, or lead, which may employ the exact same methods in harvesting ore?

Mr. Speaker, this Bill is a shoddy piece of work and the Minister needs to rewrite it or withdraw it entirely.

I think it's worth it, but I recognize that it only makes sense if you have some optimism that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.  I know enough smart people who are convinced ethical funds make no difference that I'm not confident that there's actually some good accomplished through the money itself, but, I think it's unlikely to be making things worse. Plus, as these funds gain market share and visibility they grow awareness and dialog around what our values are and how that connects to money. 

Also, I think that there's an argument that ethical investments are less risky-- if a business is more exploitative or it goes against common values, I think it's more likely that customers, competitors, and/or regulators find a way to make it so the business can't keep profiting by doing what it's doing.

5898,2552,"Mr Speaker,

This bill perhaps has good intent but as it is the bill before this House promises to lead this nation to ruin. As I fear that it will pass this initial reading, I call on Members of Parliament to work on writing up amendments to it posthaste.

First, let us point out the elephant in the room here; a savings fund is meant to bring the most return to its trustees in the determined period of time. By putting restrictions on the management of personal savings, as is the case of KiwiSaver, or the Government Superannuation Fund, meant for our hard-working state sector employees, this government opens up the possibility for these funds to be more reliant on worse investments. Not only does this directly undermine the idea of the funds serving those who benefit from it, it also opens up risk within this funds. With worse investments, it means that more of them will likely become loss-making and therefore increase the chance that the funds remain healthy, safe ways for our citizens and state sector employees to rely on. It really is irresponsible the way that the government currently pursues a policy with such disregard for both the financial health of individuals and those it directly hires.

Now, Mr Speaker, I'd like to address the issues related to the terms of the bill. We see the terms 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' littered about, but what does it actually mean? Luckily the Minister for Foreign Affairs has put these sections in next to ones which actually do have meaning, but as it is the term 'ethical' in this bill is just pandering and meaningless because it is undefined and left for the bureaucrats who enforce the bill to determine. Do we want unelected people to determine what is ethical on behalf of the country? I am not so sure. 

As for the stricter guidelines in this bill found in Schedule 1, there are multiple glaring issues there as well. There is the awkwardly-worded phrase 'investments will not invest in investments involved in', one which lacks clarity whatsoever. The use of 'involved' also begs the question, what does it mean to be 'involved'? The bill must define this lest bureaucrats determine with levity what 'involvement' exactly means. Even if no other amendment passes, this part must be fixed or there will be no comprehensible reading of this bill. The bill also condemns those firms dealing with the 'manufacture of addictive substances'. May I ask what substances in particular? As written this bill could cause our funds to direct investment away from companies that make everything from video games to chocolate pudding! It needs more clarity once again. Then this bill brings up legality and human rights, one of the most unclear issues of them all here. What's an 'illegal activity' exactly? Is it just an environmental crime such as poaching or could it be any crime under any law? Could chewing gum be an 'illegal activity' under this bill since it's prohibited in Singapore? The Minister who presented this bill ought to define what is and is not illegal. In Schedule 1, (1)(e) also raises questions. Why are unconstitutional statuses necessarily negative and what qualifies as repressive? Furthermore, most countries, including this one, violate human rights of some sort. I say this again: this bill cannot be accepted without more clarification. Yes, these terms in Schedule 1 are just meant to be guidelines. These guidelines must be clear and sound however, because so many of our citizens and state sector employees depend on these funds for their savings. For such a topic of high-importance, vague suggestions should not be tolerated.

Mr Speaker, I ask that the Deputy Prime Minister withdraw this bill and rewrite it himself. Otherwise, substantive revision must occur in the amendment reading. If neither of these things happen, it ought to be rejected outright by this House, for the sake of the people's interest.

5908,2569,"Kia ora, Mr Speaker. NgƒÅ mihi nui ki a koutou, kia ora.

Mr Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, because the Green Party is and has always been a vocal supporter of ethical, responsible, and sustainable investment.

There are a couple of objectives to this bill, effectively. The first is to make capital cheaper and more available to businesses that are acting responsibly, ethically, and sustainably. That's about using our government funds, whether New Zealand First's KiwiFund, the Cullen Fund, or the ACC fund, to support business that aren't destroying the planet, that aren't acting unethically- we want them to prosper. And conversely, for businesses that are acting unethically and inappropriately, for them we want to make capital more expensive and less available.

The second underlying objective is to ensure New Zealand, as a country, lives and acts in a way that is ethical and responsible. It is no surprise that, for example, numerous KiwiSaver providers adhere to some ethical investment criteria, or at least provide an ethical option. We want to be living off these funds in a way that is socially responsible, that will shift the world in a more ethical and sustainable and humane direction.

It took years of effort to fight the unethical investments of the Cullen fund, and even today the fund still remains invested in numerous things that we, as a nation, should not be backing, and should not be trying to profit off. The Greens campaigned to get the fund out of whale meat, tobacco, and cluster funds, which was successful, but today still the fund is invested in Rio Tinto and Freeport-McMoRan, two of the largest mining companies, causing irreparable environmental damage to both land and our climate- and of course, climate change is a global issue. The fund is invested in Gazprom, the third worst industrial carbon dioxide emitter in the world. ExxonMobil, the fourth worst. The fund is invested in Halliburton, the company who profiteered off of the Iraq war. BAE Systems,  United Technologies Corp, Rolls-Royce, Babcock International, Safran- all involved in the production of nuclear weapons, and all financed by the Cullen fund. We can learn from Norway, who's pension fund has sensible ethical criteria, and is not involved with so many of the unethical and irresponsible firms that our various funds are invested in.

Mr Speaker, this bill will steer New Zealand and it's investments in a direction that is ethical and responsible. That is responsible foreign policy, that is responsible human rights policy, and it is a policy that I am proud to see put forward to the house.

5929,2607,"The case-in-point argument for corporations being socially responsible is that, in 1914‚Äî *a hundred and six years ago*‚Äî Henry Ford raised the standard carmaker wage to $5 per day. This moved the general labor market, which meant that Ford earned a lot more in revenues (because workers at other employers had more money) than he paid out in higher wages. 

It made good business sense. It was market manipulation but, unlike all the disgusting downward market manipulation unleashed on the labor market by today's companies, it worked out for good‚Äî from labor's point of view.

More than a century later, that action by Ford has been used as the main argument supporting capitalism‚Äî that capitalists lose if the workers become poor. It ain't true. For one thing, since the 1980s that problem has been ""solved"" with consumer debt rather than higher wages‚Äî companies get revenue out of money the workers don't have and therefore have to rent from the capitalist class. For another, Ford's move only works if one employer is big enough to move the general labor market‚Äî and that kind of centralization is undesirable in a capitalist system; in fact, that it is decentralized (unlike state socialism) is capitalism's main justification for its existence.

Corporations have implicitly fed us the logic that they won't destroy their host society because, at one anomalous time long ago, a man who was a union-busting antisemitic asshole but could see a business opportunity in raising the wage and forcing other employers to pay better, did so.

Capitalists don't need us to thrive. Higher wages increase revenue, but so does more consumer debt.

5960,2660,"This to me is really more about wealthsimple jumping onto a hot investment buzzword in order to increase their media copy and draw AUM, rather than an investment strategy supported by hard research.  Most of the research I've seen concludes that socially responsible investing results in less diversified portfolios, and (at *absolute best*) similar investment returns, meaning lower risk adjusted returns (you took more risk due to your lower level of diversification).  However, since SRI funds tend to require more active management (security selection and vetting) even for custom SRI index funds, a more likely eventuality is that higher fees result in lower investment returns over time.  This is also assuming that there are no periods in which low SRI stocks outperform and, so long as there is demand for commodities and products such as military hardware, alcohol and cigarettes, this thesis appears extremely unlikely.  [Larry Swedroe, whom I admire greatly, has a succinct piece where he goes over a recent study of the results of SRI funds](http://mutualfunds.com/news/2016/02/09/does-ethical-based-investing-impact-returns/), which effectively demonstrates that investors in those funds may receive a behavioural social benefit (the good feeling they get when they know that they are investing 'responsibly') but at a cost of lower investment returns.  Perhaps this is because sin companies are priced more like value stocks, while socially responsible darlings are bid up by investors seeking social benefits rather than economic ones?

In principle, if you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, SRI can never have any impact on the capital market.  At some point, even if it did influence the price of securities, the most it could do would be to effect a transfer of risk-free return between active market participants (with the socially responsible investor being the loser in this arrangement).

Generally, the prevailing wisdom is to ignore investment buzzwords and fads.  Invest in simple, timeless products like cap weighted, total market index funds (warts and all).  If you are concerned with social, economic or environmental issues affecting our planet and society (and you should be; empathy for others is an admirable human characteristic), your cause is likely to be best served by donating a portion of your investment profits to the registered charity of your choice, rather than giving it to fund companies in fees or hedge fund managers in excess returns.",really wealthsimple jump onto hot investment buzzword order increase medium copy draw aum rather investment strategy support hard research research I ve see conclude socially responsible investing result less diversified portfolio at absolute good similar investment return mean low risk adjust return you take risk due low level diversification however since sri fund tend require active management security selection vet even custom sri index fund likely eventuality high fee result low investment return time also assume period low sri stock outperform and long demand commodity product military hardware alcohol cigarette thesis appear extremely unlikely larry swedroe admire greatly succinct piece go recent study result sri fundshttpmutualfundscomnews20160209doesethicalbasedinvestingimpactreturn effectively demonstrate investor fund may receive behavioural social benefit the good feeling get know invest responsibly cost low investment return perhaps sin company price like value stock socially responsible darling bid investor seek social benefit rather economic one principle believe efficient market hypothesis sri never impact capital market point even influence price security could would effect transfer riskfree return active market participant with socially responsible investor loser arrangement generally prevail wisdom ignore investment buzzword fad invest simple timeless product like cap weight total market index fund wart all concerned social economic environmental issue affect planet society and be empathy other admirable human characteristic cause likely well serve donate portion investment profit register charity choice rather give fund company fee hedge fund manager excess return,230,0.46153846153846156,0.11304347826086956,2016-03-24 21:41:11,1,esg-bullish

I'm really more pro life than pro choice, but to be honest, I don't think I would want to carry a baby to term that would be born with any of the major Trisomies. My friend has a little girl who has DS and she found out around 20 weeks and carried to term, obviously. Her little girl is healthy physically but requires so many hours of therapies etc and like you said, may never live a long life or independent life.

&#x200B;

I know that if I revealed to that friend that I terminated for DS, she would likely never speak to me again. It's such a personal decision though really. I'm really glad I never had to make that choice. While I lost a baby in November and the cause was unknown and she was in perfect health as far as the NT scan and NIPT, there's a possibility she had something genetically wrong or physically that we couldn't see yet. That really got me thinking what I would do if I had a DS or other trisomy diagnosis. Being on the ""older"" side and my husband is as well and we have 3 other kids, I think I would terminate. It wouldn't be fair to the other kids to have so much time and attention spent on their younger sibling and as an older parent, I would want to live with or close to that child well into their adult years to help and support them and it wouldn't be as easy as I got older.

But nothing in life is guaranteed. That child could have ANYTHING happen that may affect their independence and quality of life at any point in their life. I worked in an ICU and saw it a lot. That child could be profoundly autistic and need full care. Yet we still 'take the risk' so to speak. 

I think it's actually low key eugenics to abort a child with down syndrome, especially with all the focus on this one condition (which I assume is nothing nefarious and is because it is one thing we know how to easily screen for). Like yeah, the test does test for other trisomies but do you know what they are called? The test clearly has a big focus on Down Syndrome for most people. I'm a bit hesitant to say eugenics coz it sounds horrid and judgy but that is kind of what it is by definition-so I think it's important to consider this with your choice too. 

I don't say this as some pro life nutter. I say this as a person who has already had to think about this when a few markers came up for my first child on his anatomy scan. The result is a healthy toddler but we sure had a lot of thinking to do in those earlier days.

It probably helps that both of us have experience working with children with disabilities, plus my sister has muscular dystrophy and I grew up helping out with her. I guess we have a realistic perspective on it and don‚Äôt see it as life ruining like some people? Life goes on, disability happens. You still find joy even though it is hard at times.

Everyone always says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd get an abortion because their quality of life will suck and it‚Äôs a mercy for them.‚Äù Eh. In extreme cases, sure. I think people with disabilities‚Äô lives are certainly harder but they definitely want to be alive. This mentality really pisses my sister off in particular, lol.

But to be honest, the biggest reason I couldn‚Äôt do it is because I‚Äôm too young for insurance to cover the early genetic testing. I wouldn‚Äôt find out about Down‚Äôs syndrome until the anatomy scan and the idea of getting a second trimester abortion is brutal and sickens me. I could never get over it. It would be hard enough to do that for legit medical reasons, let alone getting rid of my kicking, squirming, hiccuping and otherwise healthy little baby because of Down‚Äôs syndrome.

6109,2920,"What do you think about the idea/prediction/mentality that Nuclear is going to start replacing Coal as the ""stable"" energy source?

One of the main benefits of coal is that it's very good at producing consistent energy output.  Solar can only be produced during the day and depends on the weather.  Wind is fairly consistent, but still somewhat weather-dependant and storms and high winds can force turbines to park to avoid damage, cutting power.  Hydro is consistent, but the locations hydro can be built are limited.

So I've heard a lot of people say that Nuclear is going to replace coal as the stable, consistent energy supplier with reliability other renewables can't reach.

Only problem I have with this idea is that nuclear fuel is expensive.  With coal, if demand is low because of cheap renewables they can just burn less coal and save on costs.  But nuclear fuel is kind of *always* ""burning"".  Even when the control rods are inserted to reduce power, the fuel rods are being expended at the same rate.  Meaning nuclear becomes *super* expensive to run if it has to compete with cheaper renewables.

I use a basic 120 rule which is 120-Age = Equity % Allocation and I move down to the previous 5 year mark.  For example, I'm 39 so I use 35, 120-35=85/15 Equities/Bonds.

The Wheeler project is estimated to have 109 million lbs, so it is sort of a drop in the bucket, but it feels to me like DNN isn't acting from a position of power. I suppose the contract is probably better than DNN issuing new shares to the public for funding exploration.

Can you recommend some companies to keep an eye on in terms of the Uranium market? A friend of mine recommended me to watch GoviEx Uranium, which has been a fine investment for him. I speak as an inexperienced investor, but seeing the high peaks of a stock and the equivalent yields in percentage, it seems like it's too late. However you seem to be proving the opposite. In any case it would be very nice, at least as a case, to be recommended some companies that I can observe and analyse - eventually buy in on.

Furthermore can you put words on what your exit strategy would be and would investments in Uranium be, in time, a short term investment (1 year or less)?

6420,3667,"Background first: my daughter is about to turn 11. We didn't know she had DS until after she was born, so we never had a choice to consider. If we had known ahead of time, I would have strongly wanted to consider aborting, and I probably would have been in favor of it. My wife absolutely would not have done it, though, so it's a moot question.

Eleven years later, I can tell you that there's no way I'd give up my daughter, I don't wish that we hadn't had her, nothing like that. She's awesome, and I love having her. But my love for and attachment to her is completely post-birth -- she's now a living, breathing, person to me, so I can no longer imagine my world without her.

However, if I didn't know her, was back 12 years ago and told that the baby is going to have Down? Yep, I'd still strongly consider aborting.

That's the background and context. Here's my advice:

First, it's a decision for you and your wife.  Anyone who tells you that they know the ""right"" answer, whether it's by religion, experience, knowledge of society, whatever -- they're wrong. The decision belongs to you two.

Second, a negative: you're going to hear plenty of people talk about how ""Down Syndrome made our lives better. We're so blessed with this gift. Blah blah blah."" I'm happy that those people feel that way. If that's part of their paradigm, great. It doesn't work for me. IMO, it's not a fucking gift. My daughter is great. The Down Syndrome sucks. It brings health threats, stress that you don't have with non-DS kids, bullying from the shitty people in society, and more. Having a child with Down Syndrome is NOT just like having any other child, no matter how people like to dismiss it as such.

Third, a positive: IMO, there is still a lot of truth to the ""every child is different anyway"" philosophy, and the differences that come with Down Syndrome sometimes do actually cause positives. In my case, I've become far more patient with (most) people, because I've had to learn to be so much more patient with my daughter. I'm also convinced that having a special needs child facilitates us meeting some of the best people in the world, whom we might not have encountered otherwise.

Some things to expect: you can expect to have as many positive and happy moments as you would have with any other child -- expect to closely examine and possibly adjust your expectations to make sure you don't miss these. Expect to plan, and most likely to stress a bit or a lot; you'll need to figure out how your child will be cared for when you're no longer capable of providing care. Expect to learn a lot about working with schools and other organizations who might need to accommodate your child's needs -- some of these will embrace your situation, others will be outright antagonistic, and you'll have to figure out how to navigate them. Expect additional stress between you and your wife when Down brings you a truly trying moment, and plan ahead for how you two will cope together when it happens. There's a reason the divorce rate of parents in the special needs community is so much higher than in the rest of society. 

I know it sounds like I'm calling out all the negatives, but face it -- most of the differences brought by DS are negatives. That doesn't mean you can't handle them in a happy, healthy, positive way. It just means that DS brings you a high chance of heart perforations and mental retardation; it never brings you super immunity and an invitation from MENSA. The key, IMO, is to be sure that you can make a happy family life with the successes your child will have -- life will still be wonderful, it'll just likely be a wonderful different from what you pictured when you thought about having a child.",background first daughter turn 11 know ds bear never choice consider known ahead time would strongly want consider abort probably would favor it wife absolutely would done it though moot question eleven year later tell there s way i d give daughter wish she nothing like that awesome love her love attachment completely postbirth live breathing person I long imagine world without she however know she back 12 year ago tell baby go down yep i d still strongly consider abort that s background context here advice first decision wife anyone tell know right answer whether religion experience knowledge society whatever they re wrong decision belong two second negative going hear plenty people talk down syndrome make life well be bless gift blah blah blah I m happy people feel way that s part paradigm great work I imo fucking gift daughter great syndrome suck bring health threat stress nond kid bully shitty people society more child syndrome like child matter people like dismiss such third positive imo still lot truth every child different anyway philosophy difference come syndrome sometimes actually cause positive case I ve become far patient most people I ve learn much patient daughter I m also convinced special need child facilitate we meet good people world might encounter otherwise thing expect expect many positive happy moment would child expect closely examine possibly adjust expectation make sure miss these expect plan likely stress bit lot need figure child care long capable providing care expect learn lot work school organization might need accommodate child need embrace situation other outright antagonistic figure navigate they expect additional stress wife bring truly try moment plan ahead two cope together happen there s reason divorce rate parent special need community much high rest society know sound like I m call negative face difference bring ds negative mean ca nt handle happy healthy positive way mean ds bring high chance heart perforation mental retardation never bring super immunity invitation mensa key imo sure make happy family life success child life still wonderful it ll likely wonderful different picture thought child,347,-0.09090909090909091,0.09510086455331412,2018-06-20 14:34:25,-1,esg-bearish

Now, I do believe centrism is a sort of flawed concept, as it really means (most of the time) that you're at the center of the current political leaning in your country. Very few people actual take a dead center political perspective, and those who say they do tend to show a political lean without realizing it.

For example, America has been leaning right politically for a long time, meaning the two party system is more like ""Do you want to push slightly to the right or push as far as possible to the right?"" and going in the center of that is basically saying ""I want to push moderately to the right!""",time here tell sub attack actual centrist enlighten centrist believe fart smell well totally pick side one literally right winger denial playing pretend sway people right now believe centrism sort flaw concept really mean most time center current political lean country people actual take dead center political perspective say tend show political lean without realize it example america lean right politically long time mean two party system like do want push slightly right push far possible right go center basically say I want push moderately right,86,-0.6,0.05813953488372093,2020-01-11 08:21:40,-1,esg-bearish

6426,3684,"I have been in your shoes also, so hopefully my story will be helpful.

I have been pro life since I was old enough to understand what that means.  But when we got our diagnosis (about the same time as you), termination suddenly seemed like a serious option.  I felt so much shame for considering termination, but at the same time, I knew there was no way to bring my child into the world unless my wife and I were fully on board.  We spent several nights just crying on the couch together.  Even without making a decision, we were in mourning, because we had lost the child that we were expecting to bring into this world. We stopped telling people about the pregnancy, because if we decided to terminate, we didn't want our friends to know about it.  

A few weeks passed, and the day came where the doctor asked us if we wanted to get an amniocentesis to confirm the diagnosis.  An amnio, as you will find out, has very high accuracy but also a very small chance of causing a miscarriage.  We decided that we didn't need confirmation, because we were going to keep the baby no matter what.  Looking back, I think that is when the healing truly started to begin.  By the time our daughter was born, we were not only ready, we were excited. 

There is no easy path to get to this decision, and nobody--not me, or your family, or anyone else--can tell you what decision to make.  Take your time.  Allow your hearts and minds to slow down a little.  Nothing but time will heal the hurt that you are feeling right now.  You are mourning, and mourning has to run its course.  Either you are mourning the loss of another child, or you are mourning that your child won't have the life that you dreamed for him or her.   

But that said, once the mourning has run its course, there is joy on the other end like you could never imagine.  Although I am glad that I allowed myself to seriously consider termination as an option, not a day goes by that I don't thank God that we decided to keep our daughter.  She is without a doubt the best thing to ever happen to me, and the light of my life.  She has so much joy, and even though she takes longer than her peers to do certain things, she loves life to the fullest and enriches those around her.

Don't do it right away, as it will be too much to process, but in the coming weeks, find a down syndrome support group in your area and connect with other families.  You are not alone in this.

6452,3754,"What *kinds* of recommendations do you make? How do you approach communicating with the general public? 

In my view, sustainability/environmental professionals are in danger of confusing consumers to the point of inaction. 

Plastic grocery bags are a good example. Selecting paper over plastic doesn't have much of a beneficial impact, if it even has a  positive impact at all. And yet for a period, consumers acted as if that decision was most important environmental decision that they made in the supermarket. (And we know it's very, very far from that.) 

In my view, professionals like you need to focus on recommendations about *product-category* decisions rather than *product* decisions, and make recommendations that are easy to understand and (hopefully) follow. 

Don't tell people which car to buy (a product-level decision), tell them how to get the service of transportation (a product-category decision). Walking, biking, and taking mass transit (product category) are all much more important than selecting a Camry versus an Accord (product-level). 

Recommendations at the product level (e.g., taking Colgate toothpaste over Crest) tend to be sensitive to where the person is living and what environmental impacts they care most about. They're fragile recommendations (e.g., because they rely on assumptions and data they rely on aren't particularly generalizable). And so, professionals in this field end up sending mixed messages to consumers who want to care, but get disheartened when they put effort into doing the right thing, and it turns out that it's not the right thing after all. 

It reminds me of the nutrition field, which can't make up it's mind about a lot of different foods, such as eggs. Are they good or bad for you? They're not really clear either way, so as a consumer, I eventually say, ""Forget it. I'll eat eggs if I want to.""  

Environmental messages are in severe danger of generating apathy in the same way. 

I can (and have) written about all this for hours, so I should stop here and say that I'd be happy to hear your thoughts.

6456,3769,"I have a bit of a non-conventional view about abortion.  For myself, I am pro-life.  But for the rest of the world, I am pro choice.  

I found out about my daughters diagnosis after she was born.  So I never had to grapple with what you and your wife are going through right now. I do know I would have kept my daughter either way.  But that‚Äôs because I am me.  You are you.  Your life and family dynamic and personalities and finances are different than mine.  There is no right answer.  Which makes this kind of diagnosis much harder.  

The fact is, not everyone is capable of being a parent to a disabled child.  Down syndrome is pretty mild compared to some of the other diagnosis out there.  But it does still come with additional and specific hardships and trials.  I have seen several parents who because they accepted something they couldn‚Äôt handle, have destroyed their lives and lead to their disabled child being forced to live a life of abuse and neglect.  Not being able to handle a disabled child does not make you a bad person.  But accepting one and then not meeting their needs and the responsibilities you accepted, does.

Before my daughter, the idea of being a parent to a disabled child wasn‚Äôt ever something I thought I wanted.  I had no real interactions with those with either physical or mental disabilities, except for a few instances.  I did t believe I was capable of it.  So when my daughter was born and we learned of her diagnosis, i was shattered.  I was so scared.  I felt so inadequate.  I felt so guilty of wanting my daughter to be something she wasn‚Äôt.  I mourned the daughter I thought I was having.  I was so overwhelmed by what I didn‚Äôt know, by what I thought my life would be like.  It was like my life stopped, and now all of a sudden I was living a life I never planned on or wanted. 

What I wish I could show you now, what I wish I had know when I was going through what you are, is how normal my life is.  How normal my daughters life is.  Yes, there are more doctors visits, and specialists.  There are different teachers, and different milestones met in different ways.  But so much of our everyday life is exactly the same as everyone else‚Äôs.  My daughter does have DS, but it‚Äôs such a small part of who she is.  She is still the little girl I carried and wanted.  She is exactly who she was supposed to be.  She just had a surprise we didn‚Äôt know about.  I truly love my daughter.  Not in spite of her DS, but because of who she is, because of everything she is.  She is smart, and cute, and funny, and sweet.  She loves her older sister and her cats.  She loves to help cook, and to color, and read.  She loves dancing and singing.  She loves playing with her baby dolls.  She fights with me and her sister, just like other kids.  She will refuse to wear pants, just like other kids.  She will sneak into the hidden candy stash and try and get out of being in trouble, just like other kids.  She goes to school. She has friends.  She goes swimming. She loves play grounds and museums.  

While I don‚Äôt think being a parent to a disabled child is for everyone, I also don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs something only special people can do.  I‚Äôm not really any different than other parents.  I‚Äôm not specially gifted for the difficulties that my daughter brings with her.  I‚Äôm constantly learning and messing up, just like every other parent in the world.  But there are things that I do believe I would never have learned or gained because of my daughter.  The person I am today, is someone I am very proud to be.  And I owe a lot of that to my daughter.

I‚Äôm so sorry for what you are going through.  I wish there was something I could say that made this easier for you.  But what I want you to know, is that there isn‚Äôt a wrong decision.  Just the right decision for you and your family.  And if that decision is keeping the pregnancy, you will have a whole community of people in real life and on line who will be there to support you.

6482,3839,"Thanks for doing this AMA. I knew I recognized your names as my own dissertation's bibliography included a lot of your work. I conducted the life cycle inventory and assessment of wood and switchgrass biofuel pellets. During my work what I found frustrating about the LCA process is: 1) a percieved lack of US data (US LCI/ecoinvent) that leads to 2) a sometimes rather heavy reliance on assumptions. 

While my research expanded on my inventory and assessment to include implications for government policy in the US, I became a bit disheartened by the value of LCA until our US data
expands. Of course it can only do that by conducting more and more inventories. 

So my questions to you both are: 

Since 2012 (when I did my research) has US data expanded or improved significantly? And does DOW encourage or fund scientists or Universities to expand inventories?

6484,3844,"I've been asked by my (usually far-left) friends how I could possibly invest in those EVIL wall street corporations, most of which are destroying everything good on the planet.  I always tell them they should learn what it really means to buy a stock.  

Let's say there is a company called Cat Fucker Incorporated.  I really like cats and I certainly don't want to see any cats harmed.  But let's say that Cat Fucker Inc. has been a publically traded company for a long time now, and I see evidence that the industry is about to explode and that the company is about to do very well.  

Being a wise investor I will buy shares of Cat Fucker and hopefully later sell those shares to another investor for a profit.  

What does that mean?  Will I be giving money to Cat Fucker Incorporated?  Absolutely not!  I will be giving money to somebody else, probably somebody just like me that once believed it was a good idea to own shares in the company.  Maybe they would be profiting from my purchase, or maybe they would be selling it for a loss.  The Cat Fucker people made money from those shares long ago during its IPO.  I'm not giving anything to them.  

In fact, only the actual CUSTOMERS of Cat Fucker Inc. are enabling the company to make money.  Stocks follow earnings, or perceived future earnings.  

So if you are concerned about companies that do harm to the world vote with you wallet and don't spend money on their products.  But don't worry about which companies you invest in.  You are NOT contributing in any way to the things the companies do (that includes companies that do GOOD things too!)

If you invest wisely you can earn money and use that money to help the world.  Maybe you can even save some cats.

I'm wondering what your opinion is in terms of current pricing levels, how much of DNN/UUU's share price are still inflated and hungover from the hype rally we saw at the start of February? eg. Well under 1$ for DNN and around 4$ for UUUU.

I have some more general questions on the topic.

To what extend do you include biotechnology in the life cycle thinking? By that I mean production of biofuels, colours, gases with biotechnological processes and organisms (algae, microorganisms). What about biotech production of useful items from waste?

How do you successfully communicate on the topic with general public and government? How do you tackle the education on sustainability throughout different fields of professions? How do you promote a public discussion?

What would be your recommendation for the ""mindset change"" of people. Numerous people know about the sustainability problem yet very few people do something about it. Since people are not directly affected they will not change their minds. One way is to integrate such topics into the education system - primary, high school and universities.

We can't just simply come up with theories, apply those theories and pass subsequent legislation blindly without considering the human impact.

If convincing people to make the right choices with regards to sustainability is ultimately what the goal of your project is, how do you plan on tackling this hurdle?

Look at the Clean Water Act and Magnusson-Stevens Act for example.  Compliance is enforced in those instances to the point people not only believe in the intrinsic benefits of clean water and sustainable fisheries, but the actual consequences of violating such statutes have real human impacts (let's be real, we love the environment, but those acts are also there to ensure people still have jobs at the end of the day).

The other camp is the ""organics"" type guys. They tend to have much lower yields, but also lower inputs and fewer negative impacts.

Those in the organics tend to speak vitriol about conventional growers as if they were monsters, and although they often have their heart in the right place they are usually delusional about the practical chances of replacing conventional production with their style while feeding the ever growing population.

Those in the conventional group tend to reject anything that even suggests organics/sustainability outright as if there were nothing to it.

So to conclude my rant, my belief (have grown MILLIONS of vegetable plants in every different system possible) is that we need some sort of hybrid system combining the best of both worlds. Things such as bacterial and fungal symbiosis have been shown to have fantastic benefits even in hydroponic scenarios, and bio-control of pests is becoming even more attractive as pesticide resistance increases. Conversely, some things are conventional for a reason. Many nutrients simply do not become soluble enough for effective drip use, and there are many VERY labor-intensive things required for non-conventional growth (like tilling, filling bags, flushing pipes, etc) which in some cases drive the labor costs so high that it offsets any benefits the system would have.

So, do you think that there should be more co-operation between conventional and organic-sustainable-ecofriendly agriculture?",hey guy work sustainability specifically agriculture work theory belief want input experience two main camp agriculture conventional group experience great yield uniformity reliability etc high input sometimes negative effect environment camp organic type guy tend much low yield also lower input few negative impact work group notice distinct polarization organic tend speak vitriol conventional grower monster although often heart right place usually delusional practical chance replace conventional production style feed ever grow population conventional group tend reject anything even suggest organicssustainability outright nothing it conclude rant belief have grow million vegetable plant every different system possible need sort hybrid system combine good world thing bacterial fungal symbiosis show fantastic benefit even hydroponic scenario biocontrol pest become even attractive pesticide resistance increase conversely thing conventional reason many nutrient simply become soluble enough effective drip use many laborintensive thing require nonconventional growth like till filling bag flush pipe etc case drive labor cost high offset benefit system would have so think cooperation conventional organicsustainableecofriendly agriculture,163,0.043478260869565216,0.1411042944785276,2015-09-14 16:37:04,1,esg-bullish

6624,4245,"Clearly, you are thinking of the baby in its current state as a person to whom you owe something. Maybe there's a religious element to this, maybe something more secular. In my mind, it's virtually impossible for someone else to talk you out of that philosophical viewpoint on a forum.   


To put it another way: for me, this would be one of the easiest decisions ever. I don't say this to be rude. I know and understand why a lot of people would find this to be a hard decision. Still, I think it's important to explain that it would be a very easy decision for many people. Hard decisions are where the choices seems to have pros and cons that balance each other and are difficult to weigh: vanilla vs. chocolate would be a harder decision for many people.  


Imagine that you think  without a religious viewpoint (e.g. thinking that a child is a gift from God). Now, imagine that birth control failed and you had to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy. If you were going to postpone having a child for another year or two, it might be a difficult decision: maybe we should have this one. But, if you were absolutely certain that you did not want a child, the decision is a simple one: have an abortion.   


You need to ask yourself the most important question: why are we having a child? You made a decision to have a child...why? In essence, children are great values to us parent... they bring so much joy in so many ways. One of the ways in which they do this is that we get to help them grow up, we get a chance to give them our values, and see them grow into certain types of adults. If this is part of your motivation, then there is a point at which a kid with significant living disabilities is not going to fulfill your core reasons for having a child in the first place.   
These days, there is so much technology and other support, so one can fulfill one's reasons even if one has a kid with disabilities that would have been debilitating a generation ago: but there's a limit.  


Of course if you have a kid and they meet with some catastrophe, you will do all you can to support them. But, this is not a living, breathing person yet. Really, only a religious or similarly mystical view can equate a baby at 20 or so weeks with a  full human person.   


Another important aspect about having kids is that they come with a cost: all kids do. Nobody can ever prepare you enough for how much your life changes when you have kids. So much of your world starts to revolve around their needs, goals, schedules. This is increasingly true as families are smaller and neighbors are more distant. When you decide to have a kid, you with the values against these costs. With a kid who has significant disabilities, these costs (not talking money... mostly, mental focus, and also time)... go up. At some point, they bog you down.  


Can you get through it? Sure, so many people do? if you have the kid, will you love it and be happy that you had it, and tremble at the thought that you contemplated abortion: almost certainly...once you have a living, breathing -- most importantly, interacting -- human child, you will be a great parent and enjoy your parenting.  


But, you would lie to yourself if you thought these were the costs and benefits that you signed up for when you decided to have a kid. Sometimes nature messes up. It's part of life, but you don't have to resign yourself to it anymore than you would resign yourself to some other tragedy for which you have an easy solution.",clearly think baby current state person owe something maybe there s religious element this maybe something secular mind virtually impossible someone else talk philosophical viewpoint forum put another way I would one easy decision ever say rude know understand lot people would find hard decision still think important explain would easy decision many people hard decision choice seem pro con balance difficult weigh vanilla vs chocolate would hard decision many people imagine think without religious viewpoint eg think child gift god now imagine birth control fail decide whether terminate pregnancy go postpone child another year two might difficult decision maybe one but absolutely certain want child decision simple one abortion need ask important question child make decision childwhy essence child great value we parent bring much joy many way one way get help grow up get chance give value see grow certain type adult part motivation point kid significant living disability go fulfill core reason child first place day much technology support one fulfill one reason even one kid disability would debilitate generation ago there s limit course kid meet catastrophe support they but live breathing person yet really religious similarly mystical view equate baby 20 week full human person another important aspect kid come cost kid do nobody ever prepare enough much life change kid much world start revolve around need goal schedule increasingly true family small neighbor distant decide kid value cost kid significant disability cost not talk money mostly mental focus also time go up point bog down get it sure many people do kid love happy it tremble think contemplate abortion almost certainlyonce living breathing importantly interact human child great parent enjoy parenting but would lie think cost benefit sign decide kid sometimes nature mess up part life resign anymore would resign tragedy easy solution,299,-0.42857142857142855,0.09364548494983277,2018-06-15 23:55:46,-1,esg-bearish

6630,4262,"Hey I want to start by saying I'm so sorry you're having to go through this especially on top of your previous losses. It's not fair.

I'll try to keep this reasonably short but we found out after our baby was born that he has Down Syndrome - all our screenings were normal throughout the pregnancy so it was the biggest shock of our lives. During his month long NICU stay we agonized over what to do and eventually settled on making an adoption plan for our baby. We did a ton of research and talked to everyone we could (doctors, staff from Down Syndrome clinics, etc.). 

We knew that we could have made it work but when we looked at other families and found one that could do it better we made our choice so that he would have the best chance at a good life. Our child is with a family whose first choice was a child with Down Syndrome. He has a sibling who also has Down Syndrome, two parents who work part-time and can both be at every appointment, grandparents who are financially independent and available to help with childcare. These are things we could not have given him. My husband and I also both felt we would not be able to have another child if we would have chosen to parent our son because we didn't feel it was fair to knowingly place the burden of his care after we die on a younger sibling.

We love our baby but given the chance we would have ended the pregnancy. Even though he has an excellent chance of being high functioning due to being so healthy - he doesn't need any surgeries like many babies with DS do, I still know he will probably never be completely independent. My heart breaks every day knowing our son will never have the chance to be normal, will never have the chance to blend in, will always have a recognizable disability. 

It is very hard to go on for us. Some days it feels like the rest of my life will be viewed through this lens of sadness even though I know we will eventually heal. It has been hard to go back out in the community - everyone sees you are pregnant and then you're not pregnant any more and there's no baby and people want to know what happened. I really didn't want to lie and tell people he died so then I had to explain our choices. People are generally supportive but there are those who think (and tell you) 'oh I would never give my baby away'. People who are not in our situation and never will be all feel free to share their opinions on our life. 

An excellent book that really helped me is 'Shattered Dreams, Lonely Choices' by Joanne Finnegan. It is older and adoption-oriented but I think it could also be helpful in your situation. For me reading about other parents in similar situations having the same thoughts was very comforting. 

Please feel free to message me any questions you may have, my heart goes out to you and your wife.

6641,4296,"I volunteer with a group of DS kids on occasion. In a lot of ways, they're just like any other children. They run around like maniacs. They give random hugs. They have a great sense of humor, and many of them love to dance. There is a spectrum of mental disability there that varies from child to child. Some are verbal, and some aren't but they communicate in other ways (tablet or sign language).

I'm not a parent. I only see these kids on special occasions. It's a much different story to be parenting children with this disability. They have special needs and they require more attention than non-DS children. 

What I would recommend to you is to come up with a list of things that you and your wife are willing to commit to, and what is out of the question. Then ask parents of DS children to be very honest and candid about both the good things and the bad things, and see if this is something you are willing to take on. If the answer is 'no', that doesn't make you a bad person, it just means you're being true to yourself and not committing to something that will be way over your head.

I think the major question you'll need to answer is, are you willing to commit a lot of time and effort into raising a child, without that common assumption that they'll be able to be independent upon reaching age 18? Only you and your spouse can honestly answer that. 

(I'm not trying to sound like Negative Nelly, btw. In fact I love volunteering with DS kids. I just think you should answer those serious questions you have now, and do it truthfully.

6646,4313,"This must be an incredibly difficult time for you, I‚Äôm sorry you are facing it. As a pro-choice woman, I believe it‚Äôs ultimately your wife‚Äôs choice as it‚Äôs her body. Hopefully she will hear your opinion on it though, as her husband. And hopefully whatever the choice you can move on as a married couple with whatever comes next. You may have religious beliefs that make this more difficult, I don‚Äôt know. Right now you see this as a child in the future but right now it is not the same as a full term baby. A 13 week fetus is tiny. There is essentially no brain function, it cannot survive outside the womb. I know to you it‚Äôs your child and I respect that, just want to put this in perspective. A termination is a safe and quick procedure and your wife will recover. There‚Äôs no reason you shouldn‚Äôt be able to try again.

There are pros and cons to both sides. Some women regret terminations. Some parents regret having a child with disabilities. Your child could function at a high level and live a pretty normal life. Or your child could be low functioning and live at home for the rest of their life. The latter costs much much more and not just monetarily. These are things to consider. Can you afford the possibility of putting your child in a facility if he/she needs care you can‚Äôt give? Can you handle possibly outliving your child? Can you handle giving up your retirement to care for a disabled, adult child? Potentially working for many more years to make ends meet for everyone? If you have other children what does this mean for them, their time with you and their financial stability? Can your marriage withstand it? Can you handle this alone if your wife were to die for some reason? Can she handle it if you died? These are worst case scenarios but you should prepare for all possibilities. And if you both can handle it no matter what then that‚Äôs awesome. But there‚Äôs absolutely no shame in saying you can‚Äôt and choosing a termination. You can also choose adoption, but going back to your normal life after will be hard. People will know your wife was pregnant and wonder what happened. You most likely will be judged by some. Depending on your state her family or yours could make things difficult. That child will be out there in the world and could find you someday. That‚Äôs a hard option too.

This is a terrible decision to have to make. You‚Äôre in my thoughts.

6720,4566,"You made money because you bought stocks at the bottom, and then bought in at the moment that retail investors become powerful in big enough numbers and invested the same way spiking stocks that catch a bid from amateur investors. In numbers is strength. The problem is people need the exit eventually - dividends or sale. The first won‚Äôt happen in many of these, the second requires you exit before others do if there isn‚Äôt an institutional bid to take it. Look at what happened with marijuana stocks a couple years ago to see what happens when fast retail money is the investor base. Losses over 90% in some cases. 

A good number of the stocks you went into are really flawed companies that either won‚Äôt exist or will have far lower valuations in 5 years. Some are very good and well timed companies - fb and arguably Tesla (valuation) as well as disney. But many of your picks would‚Äôve been a disaster in any other matket - this one is really unique, unlike anything that‚Äôs been seen since the late 90s and late 20s, which were the last times fast retail or retail-like money dominated.  

Jinko solar as an example had a good break but has no advantages, and is a commodity producer. It also might get delisted in a year or two because of new us rules. Solar in general is a horrible industry because it‚Äôs commodity and because China created oversupply with national industrial policy eliminating the benefit of producing more efficiently - since they‚Äôll dump product at or below cost in some cases. I know less about first solar but pretty sure most of the value is in install which is a local contractor business. Just because something is good for society doesn‚Äôt mean the industry will be profitable. Solar hasn‚Äôt been. 

Wind is just a narrow not great business. Specific wind companies may be but most of our future green energy is going to be solar, or fusion if we crack that. 

WKHS has a head start but lacks tech advantages. Tesla is the only credible ev company, so all of the possible ev companies get a huge bid. But most are bad companies that will get out competed by either Tesla or an existing large, well run auto company like Toyota or Ford. 

Rare earths are also a horrible business. It‚Äôs a global commodity. China over supplies it under national industrial policy and to get some control so everyone is now building out capacity for national strategic reasons then government will make purchases to make it survive. But you‚Äôll have a massively oversupplied commodity market which means zero or negative profits. Only up because of the retail bid. 

Common theme of a lot of your smaller green stocks is you bought stuff for which there will be revenue and a future need, but industry dynamics with the company‚Äôs strategy prevent strong profitability. 

Some of your best purchases you got pretty late and show very small returns. SHOP is up 1500% for a lot of people. Chasing a gain on a stock up 1500% in the past year can work but is aggressive. 

Anyway congrats on the gains but you need to not view these as your investing rules. This year is unlike any other and a lot of your positions stand on greater fools not selling. I would be particularly wary of any company that has been $1b of market cap or less in past 2 years and is up 5x or more in the past year, especially if it is a chinese adr or is a former penny stock. Id also be skeptical of industries that lack profitability. A lot of yours are checking most of those boxes.

You said it yourself, this works because you are buying your beliefs. A lot of new retail money is doing that and that makes this profitable now - if everyone buys it goes up. But investing works in the long run because the companies make a lot of money and/or persistently attract capital from major allocators.

Your overview and this thread have been so helpful as both an entry point and a place to return to for context. So, thanks!

Anyway, as an early step I've got a basic data sheet going that includes the 15 companies you mentioned above plus a few others, and it covers all the usual stuff (mkt cap, avg. daily vol, p/e, short interest, etc, etc.) There inevitably comes this point as I'm transferring a company's data from source to sheet when my eyes wander over to the stock chart's duration setting and I re-render the view from default to ""all time"" and my eyes lock onto '04-'07 and I semi-lose my mind.

A solid income will allow you to buy more stocks. With some extremely rare exceptions, people who spend their time creating streams of income or improving their primary stream (job/business) and buy more stocks will come out ahead of people who spend all their time trying to pick the perfect stocks.

6778,4757,"Hi I currently am living in California and am wondering what you feel are some of the major causes of drought.  Based on my schooling (BS hydrology) and personal research I believe some of them to be:
1)overdense forests (the fires seem to be another indicator of this), from what I understand native americans used to burn certain areas to keep certain streams perennial. 
2)Cloud seeding projects influence, I can see the planes laying down lines of white trails.  not sure exactly what this is however I have noticed that it is normally placed in the path of of incoming clouds and seemingly will make them fizzle out.
3) Agricultural practices, Its baffling to me that ~70% of our water use is going into producing monoculture crops that involve entirely clearing land for harvests and yet still we emphasize reduction in public water use in this state.  Also I wouldnt be surprised if 70% was a conservative estimate because who knows how well ground water is being recorded.  For instance the San Joauqin valley cancelled its water rights for farmers early this year and its my understanding that many of them were able to still pump ground water.
4)El nino cycles, Im not sure entirely on this one I have done some research into the topic but have found lots of mixed information.

I do know from experience however that in 2010 we had one of the wettest years I can remember.  So what has changed since then that would cause us to go into this extreme drought.  Please touch on the listed causes above and the probability of whether or not they are having a significant impact.  And if these arent the major causes what could be??

1. It should have been referred to an MRO who would have reversed your result to a negative upon receipt of a valid Rx or doctor's note.

Honestly, this is bullshit on both the staffing firm's and company's part.

If you're on a prescription medication the lab should never give that information to your employer and the results of your drug test should show negative.  

If we're talking about medical marijuana it can get a bit complicated.  Even if North Carolina allows medical marijuana, remember it's only quasi-legal as federal law still prohibits its use.  And many states have provisions allowing employers to disqualify candidates in sensitive positions for positive THC results even if they have a doctor's permission to take it.  I say doctor's permission because in some states (like Arkansas) you cannot get a prescription for marijuana though you can get a doctor's note to take it.

As long as you can perform the duties of the job -with or without a reasonable accommodation, - the employer legally can't consider your disability when making hiring decisions.

Vyvanse makes me much more productive, and without it I'd be all over the place. I perform much better when I'm on my meds. I'm sure you do to. There is a stigma attached to stimulants, especially in adults who take them. 

Lastly, this *could* also be a violation of an employment contract since you were basically told the job was yours, from what I can tell from your post. This is called a ""verbal contract."" Depending on the situation, if the company reneged on an employment offer AFTER you provided the information you were TOLD to provide, this could be grounds for an enforceable breach of contract. Look into Promissory estoppel too. 

I've also never heard of a lab company mention a HIPPA violation based on medication disclosure, but it may just be LabCorp policy. LabCorp had a data breach a few years ago. In other words, they test you and report results to the employer, that's it. It's then up to the employer and applicant to work out the details.

Title: **I attend a methadone clinic, last week my urine sample for a random drug test was given the wrong label. I received another patients positive results and they received my clean screen. (IN)**

Original Post: 

> Yesterday, when I went to the clinic to get my dose, I was told there was a hold on my account and needed to see my counselor. Apparently, my DT from last week came back positive for opiate & fentanyl. This is 100% impossible and my counselor said there‚Äôs a new lab tech, and that it‚Äôs possible they switched my label with someone elses. He also said this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time Its happened.
> He even had a patient in mind that it could have been switched with, because we tested around the same time and their screen came back negative while he was expecting it to be positive. 
> He told me I can pay $40 to have the sample investigated further, to see exactly what percent and substance was in the urine; but I informed him I didn‚Äôt want to pay that for someone else‚Äôs results. If I were to do that, I would have a new test done and also pay to have that sample reviewed, to cross reference both results. 
> I also asked if he could cross reference the results of everyone who took a test the same time as me, and he told me he would do that, as well as speak to his supervisor about how to go about fixing this. He does believe the results were wrong, and seems to be working on my side, but he‚Äôs also being slightly nonchalant about it. Where as I‚Äôm freaking out, this is a huge mistake for someone to make, and I do not want my record to reflect someone else‚Äôs results. 
> After meeting with my counselor yesterday he put me down for another drug test that day, which I went to do but was informed the lady left early, I then told my counselor this and he said I could take it this morning. But I received an email from him earlier, starting supervisors would not be in today due to bad weather, and they are only doing dosing today, meaning I can‚Äôt do the drug test today either. 
> I‚Äôm not sure how to go about this situation, I feel my hands are tied but I‚Äôm extremely upset and feel they should be taking this a bit more seriously than they are. 
> Any advice would be much appreciated and I‚Äôll answer any questions about what I may have left out. 
> 
> Also, my counselor does believe these aren‚Äôt my results, because I even quit smoking marijuana almost 2 weeks ago and have had no illicit substances(aside from thc) in any previous drug screens. I‚Äôve kept my counselors informed about what‚Äôs going on with me and work with them, I‚Äôm very dedicated to my sobriety. 
> 
> I asked him if the positive screen had thc in it as well, thinking that would be a dead giveaway if it didn‚Äôt, but unfortunately it did. That is why I made the comment about paying for both the old and new screen to be reviewed further, to check the amount of thc in each to see if it could prove it‚Äôs not mine, since my level would have been extremely low on last weeks result, and more than likely non-existent in this new test (that I will hopefully take tomorrow)

No form of pooled investment is going to be perfectly in tune with your beliefs.

6973,5552,">Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it‚Äôs not for you. If you‚Äôre like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there.

Congratulations on your results, and on your willingness to share your though process. My main concern is with your idea that ""traditional metrics"" are irrelevant for Tesla. Presumably you are talking about value metrics such as PE and PEG , book value, and such which can be used as a means of finding the intrinsic value of the company. 

It's true that it's very hard to value a company during hyper-growth, so those metrics become somewhat meaningless because you don't know what the real P/E is if you don't know what the earnings are actually going to be in the future.

When you buy a business for long term hold (as opposed to short term speculation that someone else will pay more for it than you paid), the ""traditional metrics"" are the only thing you would care about, because that's how you can judge whether you will make back enough money to make it worth your investment. How much would you pay for, say, a local plumbing company or gas stations that earns $250,000 per year? Would 1,000x earnings be reasonable? If so, I will happily sell you such a business for $250M bucks. That's what you're paying for TSLA today, on hopes that they will make LOTS more than they do today.

But one thing is for sure, unless TSLA in the near future earns many multiples of what it earns now, the price is going to get crushed. If the hyper-growth slows down the price will be hammered. It won't be a ""dip"" or a ""correction"", it will be a permanent loss of capital for TSLA speculators. 

For you it will be no big deal, since you are not gambling your rent money. But when this bubble pops, a lot of people who have speculated way too much money that they should not be putting at risk, will get crushed. 

Being a long term holder won't save you. In order for the value of the company to match the current prices and recover, will take decades of successful business growth. AMZN peaked at ~$86 in Dec '99 and didn't see those levels again until 2009.

7063,5929,"Here's some information on Fuel Cell industries' landscape. Most information is taken from China's Hydrogen/Fuel Cell White Paper (v2019), Japan's Hydrogen Roadmap (Oct 2020), and Europe's Hydrogen Roadmap (Feb 2019).

**Safety standards & Infrastructure**

Lots of research and testing have been done to ensure safety of Hydrogen energy & fuel cell. >10 countries have H2 transportation & refuel station standards in place.

Japan, Germany and US are leading in #of H2 refueling station installations (113/81/64) at end of 2019. China recognizes its position in the use of this important medium of energy and plans to catch up by end of 2020 to be second country to have >100 H2 refueling stations (for fuel cell cars).

Japan leads the pack in 1) H2 and Fuel Cell research 2)Vehicles produced (mostly Toyota Mirai) 3) H2 Use Cases including world's first Co-Gen Turbine (capable of gas/H2 mixtures) at 100% H2 since April 2018, supplying heat to hospital and \~1.1 MW electricity to exhibition hall at Kobe Port Island

[**Technology Breakthrough**](https://h2-industries.com/en/lohc-technology-overview/)

H2 can be transported in gas, liquified, or solid forms. Commercially gas form is the most popular currently. A Liquified Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) technology was among the finalists of the prestigious Deutscher Zukunftspreis 2018 (President's Prize). It uses an oil-like liquid to chemically bind hydrogen(57kg of H2 per 1m3 of liquid). The end product liquid can be stored and transported using existing pas storage/pipelines. It makes storage and transportation of hydrogen quite a lot safer (and cheaper) than using pressurized containers to store and transport H2 gas. In order to release the H2, the liquid is passed through catalyst. The cycle is closed - the oil-like liquid is very well-understood and could be reused many, many times. It is 1/50th of cost of lithium-ion batteries.

**Role of Hydrogen Energy**

Main use cases for fuel cells are for trucks/long hauls/buses/stationary electricity generation. Therefore, fuel cell is not a direct competitor of EV in the consumer market. In fact, Maximizing H2 use is critical in closing Carbon Emissions gap to reach the 2 Degree Scenario (2DS). EU's Hydrogen Roadmap points out seasonal energy needs (e.g. heating in winter in north of EU) cannot be satisfied by increase of power generation - there will always be excess capacity. H2 is the best option to store that excess energy. 

**InPower-LOOP Partnership**

InPower-LOOP joint venture setup its Nanjing office in Jan 2020. By April, it had won the contract with Nanjing City Bus (\~100 range extenders at \~$15 mln US$ for 3 years) with 7000 buses in the fleet to replace/refurbish, By August the production/R&D facility is completed. In my opinion LOOP is quite smart to get a foot in this market where the Chinese is heavily investing in order to catch up to (and surpass) Japan/Germany/US in the area of H2/Fuel Cell. It is quite clear that there are lots of opportunities.

China could also be a tricky market to compete in. That‚Äôs where the risks and rewards are. Being there to compete is an important step forward.

===========Some noteworthy events ==========

2017

19th Communist Party National Summit. ""build clean, low-carbon, safe & efficient modern energy eco system, promote ecological investments"". In September China Hydrogen Alliance h2cn.org was formed with participation from top universities, 19 major heavy industry players, financial institutions.

2019

Hydrogen energy first mentioned in Government of China annual report. ""to promote electrical charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure..."" First edition of [China Hydrogen Energy & Fuel Cell White Paper](http://www.h2cn.org/Uploads/File/2019/07/25/u5d396adeac15e.pdf) published.

2020

Until end of June, 70 hydrogen refueling stations were built. Estimate by year end, and China will be the second country with over 100 H2 refill stations (Japan being first place, 113 at end of 2019 according to [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/hydrogen)). In May, Sinopac (China Petroleum & Chemical Corp with US$ 314 bln market cap) announced building of 20 H2 refill stations in Guangzhou City. Sinopac has built 2 model gas/hydrogen refill stations, and will be accelerating build out in Beijing to support fuel cell powered cars for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic.

2021

Example of hydrogen refueling stations: Hyfun.cn has 9 stations in operation. 20 more under construction. Has served 64k refuels, totaling 510 tons of hydrogen. InPower (LOOP's partner in China) is promoting hydrogen production from methanol (China has a ton of cheap coal which could be used to produce methanol instead of burning to produce energy). InPower products include: hydrogen production devices, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, DC-to-DC fuel cells for 5,30,60KW outputs. InPower was established in 2008, with 110 employees (30 PhD researchers). In April InPower-Loop venture announced the 3 year contract  for \~100 range extenders (50KW)  from Nanjing city bus (fleet of 7000). InPower-Loop established the Nanjing office in Jan 2020. Took 2 months to sign the contract. In June a first model bus was completed. In Aug 2020, production and research facility in Nanjing office was completed. Nanjing City (8 million population, and capital of Jiangsu Province with 80 mln population) has been lagging in hydrogen investment until the range extender investment, and the city has intention to apply for hydrogen model city (in order to obtain strategic investment funds from the Central Government which is awarded on a first-come-first-serve basis).",here information fuel cell industry landscape information take china hydrogenfuel cell white paper v2019 japan hydrogen roadmap oct 2020 europe hydrogen roadmap feb 2019 safety standard infrastructure lot research testing do ensure safety hydrogen energy fuel cell 10 country h2 transportation refuel station standard place japan germany we lead of h2 refueling station installation 1138164 end 2019 china recognize position use important medium energy plan catch end 2020 second country 100 h2 refueling station for fuel cell car japan lead pack 1 h2 fuel cell research 2vehicle produce mostly toyota mirai 3 h2 use case include world first cogen turbine capable gash2 mixture 100 h2 since april 2018 supply heat hospital 11 mw electricity exhibition hall kobe port island technology breakthroughhttpsh2industriescomenlohctechnologyoverview h2 transport gas liquify solid form commercially gas form popular currently liquified organic hydrogen carrier lohc technology among finalist prestigious deutscher zukunftspreis 2018 president prize use oillike liquid chemically bind hydrogen57 kg h2 per 1m3 liquid end product liquid store transport use exist pas storagepipeline make storage transportation hydrogen quite lot safe and cheap use pressurize container store transport h2 gas order release h2 liquid pass catalyst cycle close oillike liquid wellunderstood could reuse many many time 150th cost lithiumion battery role hydrogen energy main use case fuel cell truckslong haulsbusesstationary electricity generation therefore fuel cell direct competitor ev consumer market fact maximize h2 use critical closing carbon emission gap reach 2 degree scenario 2ds eus hydrogen roadmap point seasonal energy need eg heating winter north eu can not satisfied increase power generation always excess capacity h2 good option store excess energy inpowerloop partnership inpowerloop joint venture setup nanjing office jan 2020 april contract nanje city bus 100 range extender 15 mln we 3 year 7000 bus fleet replacerefurbish august productionrd facility complete opinion loop quite smart get foot market chinese heavily invest order catch and surpass japangermanyus area h2fuel cell quite clear lot opportunity china could also tricky market compete in that s risk reward be compete important step forward some noteworthy event 2017 19th communist party national summit build clean lowcarbon safe efficient modern energy eco system promote ecological investment september china hydrogen alliance h2cnorg form participation top university 19 major heavy industry player financial institution 2019 hydrogen energy first mention government china annual report to promote electrical charge hydrogen refueling infrastructure first edition china hydrogen energy fuel cell white paperhttpwwwh2cnorguploadsfile20190725u5d396adeac15epdf publish 2020 end june 70 hydrogen refueling station build estimate year end china second country 100 h2 refill station japan first place 113 end 2019 accord ieahttpswwwieaorgreportshydrogen may sinopac china petroleum chemical corp we 314 bln market cap announce build 20 h2 refill station guangzhou city sinopac build 2 model gashydrogen refill station accelerate build beijing support fuel cell power car 2022 beijing winter olympic 2021 example hydrogen refueling station hyfuncn 9 station operation 20 construction serve 64k refuel total 510 ton hydrogen inpower loop partner china promote hydrogen production methanol china ton cheap coal could use produce methanol instead burn produce energy inpower product include hydrogen production device proton exchange membrane pem fuel cell dctodc fuel cell 53060kw output inpower establish 2008 110 employee 30 phd researcher april inpowerloop venture announce 3 year contract 100 range extender 50kw nanjing city bus fleet 7000 inpowerloop establish nanjing office jan 2020 take 2 month sign contract june first model bus complete aug 2020 production research facility nanjing office complete nanjing city 8 million population capital jiangsu province 80 mln population lag hydrogen investment range extender investment city intention apply hydrogen model city in order obtain strategic investment fund central government award firstcomefirstserve basis,596,-0.17647058823529413,0.05704697986577181,2021-02-26 21:02:01,-1,esg-bearish

7079,5997,"A nice little tidbit about hydrogen gas. Germany is subsidizing trillions into BP for green H2 gas. I would look for correlations between Germany and an H2 cell provider. 

Why I would wait on investing into h2 cells: Our technology in h2 fuels is still stoneage. Yes we have them working, yes, there is a lot of potential energy there. The efficiency of the gas combined with the scarcity of pumps right now, would make this a long long long term investment. That, to me, seems like making a hail mary to pick a single company. In my humble opinion, I think investing in FSKR would be a more plausible hail Mary.

Why?
They are coming out with their Ocean in q4 2022. That's likely before H2 takes off and their lease program is going to crush Uber's rates for frequent fliers. They have a more reputable parts supply than previous. The bankruptcy is the only thing that would turn me away. I just see fisker pumping out products well before h2 innovates its way into normal everyday life. You have Tesla to fight for that car market too...

7164,6358,"It was a bit of an odd choice by DoL in how they approached it. I think that they had a legitimate point that the claims made by some of the funds are not clear and/or hard to validate. However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

7210,6557,"ok let me start by saying, I myself had a false positive that is presumedly due to asymptomatic covid. I tested 6 month later with three different labs and was hiv negative so false positives are possible. but as a scientist let me explain how this works.

the 4th gen test, tests for early antibodies igm, late antibodies Igg and p24 antigen. since 4th gen test became the starting screening point they had to add another step to the algorithm to account for the p24 antigen. basically the second antibody test confirms whether you reacted to the antibody and if thats negative, they have to make sure you didn't react to the p24 which is why they have to do pcr which tests for viral load. in the past that 3rd gen test (antibody only) tests were the starting point the confirmatory test would be a western blot which also is an antibody test.

Now if you're in the US the differentiation assay they use is Geenius which is very close to western blot and it has lines that become positive in early infection and it detects Igg so usually if people are seroconverting they have positive first test and indeterminate second test. The fact that your second test is fully negative is reassuring. The only way for you to be positive is to either be one of those rare infection cases on prep or acute infection of hiv1 or very early infection of hiv 2. I've been there and I know how sick you feel when you don't know if you have hiv or not and in my case I had to wait 6 months to do a retest so believe me I know it's torture! 

Now at the end of the day false positives and false negatives have happened literally in any test even in hiv dna tests and at the end of the day what clarified a situation of the clinical probability of the person actually having hiv. did you have an exposure in the last 3-4 months? if not, you're probably ok and if thats the case maybe you can go take a rapid hiv test at a community center in this week to calm yourself a bit. all the rapid hiv tests used in the US test for Igm and igg and some even p24.

I don't understand how you and others have come to this conclusion. Their rivals source from MASSIVE outdoor duckweed farms in tropical areas. Most duckweed protein ends up in animal feed because no one wants it.

Scalability and efficiency isn't the problem with selling duckweed powder. And growing duckweed indoors and with Canadian labour costs can't possibly be more scalable or efficient.

Their aquaculture plan is a novelty for marketing, but will put them at a disadvantage with price.

I think you are spot on with the other risk factors you identified.

One more note to add as a risk is that you can't sell products with duckweed ingredients for human consumption in the EU, so their market for the product or for licensing their system is more limited than you might expect

And another thought: Their target market is people with plant-based diets, but most of those people are vegan and avoid supporting animal-use industries.

Propane cylinder increased, but bulk/tank-business decreased. Bulk is the business with higher Volume and margin. So the result/developement is primarily negative. And I guess LPG-Volume also sunk (electrifikation; less Traffic because of corona). Maybe some Industrie-Clients can't pay their bill. For sure there is some bad debt.

The Oil/gasprice bedinning/mid. 2020 was very low. Now 2021 its much higher compared to 2020 and Margin most times lower. My prediction is that propane price will stay at the today's lvl. The Big Producers seem to have found a deal on the 50 -60 USD LVL.

There is enough propane-production nearly as much as Oil.  

Conclusion propane a solid business not more and not less. There isn¬¥t such a lot of headroom. 

The lower stock price is maybe fair, consider corona:

\- some costumers maybe can't pay their bill.

\- some bigger costumers won't exist because they're insolvent. So lower volume in the future.

So UGI, DCC and SHP in best case will go to their pre-corona Value. Maybe today its undervalued but not as much as it seem in the posts.

The Republicans won the 2020 elections overall in the face of their disavowal of the health and welfare of the people.

Locally, the PA house and senate continue to be Republicans who backed lawsuits to disrupt the attempts to control the virus, encouraged crazy fuckfaces to go out and protest virus controls, and who set up a local small business scheme that saw millions go to ACCUWEATHER and EDGAR SYNDER rather than legit small businesses that were actually impacted by the pandemic. Voters in counties that voted for Biden split ticket and voted for local Republicans, knocking off people such as the democratic house leader.

Unfortunately our cord blood clotted after they took it (10 pm birth) so they had a NICU nurse come and do an arterial blood draw which was so easy and no big deal. I actually wish I'd opted for delayed cord clamping instead of the cord blood draw, so that's something to consider if you give birth at night - the blood they collect may clot before they can send it off in the morning. 

Like you we had no signs on amnio, except that past 32ish weeks her long bones started measuring short. At this point I was convinced she had Mosaic Turner. They didn't think a fetal echo was necessary after a very long and detailed look at the heart twice at my MFM. At birth they sent the blood to the Mayo Clinic for a targeted FISH, the results came back in about a week that she was normal XX. I cried so much on the phone when they told me!

The only choice I regret was getting the NIPT in the first place. I don't regret not getting the amnio. It was terribly stressful waiting, but especially knowing that she has normal chromosomes, I am glad I didn't risk the ammio. She was already an IUD post Covid infection baby, so a bit of a miracle.

During this difficult time you may be looking information about what the NIPT results you received mean. There are 2 main sticky posts about what NIPT is, how it works, what it can miss and how false positives happen, sono findings, and your chances of a true positive after NIPT.
POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE CALCULATOR FOR NIPT RESULTS https://www.perinatalquality.org/Vendors/NSGC/NIPT/

*I highly suggest you first read through everything in main post located here to start:

*After this head over to this post about the actual individual results:

Please also place a flair on your username which can be done by going to the right side of the sub -- community options -- and update username flair. This updates the flair on your username IN THIS SUB ONLY. This is so when you speak to others, they immediately understand your situation AND you can see their situation summary. There are some options filled in, but you can also write in your own result.


Please place POST FLAIR on your actual post. These are in different colors and allows users to actually click on the post flair and pull up every post that has a similar situation such as -no results-trisomy 13-NT scan question-etc. Clicking on the green -no result post flair- will bring up everyone who has also tagged their submission as no results/low fetal fractions and you can read up their stories/outcomes and responses (or any other topic that is common for NIPT results.


Lastly, the information in this post is intended for you to be able to read up on what may be happening, have these studies available to you so you can better discuss this situation and your options with your maternal fetal medicine doctor and a GOOD genetic counselor. You always have a right to speak to a genetic counselor after an abnormal NIPT result and this should be provided for you by your OB. If you have been incorrectly told that the accuracy of your result is 99% without a proper Predictive Value calculation please report this somewhere as this actually leads to wrongful terminations of pregnancies in that office. That OB needs further education about NIPT positives and how to present such information as well as knowledge of the Positive Predictive Value of NIPT based on age. You could make a big difference by making sure this never happens again in the OB's office for future patients such as yourself.


As always, take any information given here and online for what it is - information - and always discuss further treatment plans with your physicians, however with caution. Not all physicians are actually up to date with NIPT testing, what results mean or how to present such SCREENING results to a patient. You will see this come up in posts across this sub.


My intention is that you have as much information about what may be going on and can make informed decisions with your treatment team moving forward.


THIS IS A SCREENING AND NOT A DIAGNOSTIC TEST

Your nugget on investing in Big Themes is spot on. Which is probably why some of the renewable energy/battery counters like D&O, Greatech, Solarvest (and so on) are still holding up even with the last market corrections. They didn't sell down horribly like the penny-stocks of last week.

**For nuclear energy, it is actually PRETTY safe.** Except for the few incidences like Fukushima and Chernobyl, nuclear plants haven't had very many meltdowns.

What nuclear plants SHOULD have are safety protocols and tech that are constantly and rigorously updated and funded aptly...no space to be lazy here.

The Wikipedia page on Fukushima incident showed there were a few 2000, 2008 studies that detailed risk of tsunami and seawater flooding for the plant...but the stupid fucks ignored them.

The Chernobyl incident also had similar fuck-ups.

From the Wiki:

*""It was stated that at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficient understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to expedite the electrical test completion.""*

While Singapore's administration is generally very competent (even in managing their current resources), I can't say the same for many countries-including ours. So thankfully not every nation has hopped onto nuclear.

(So I guess part of the FA due diligence will have to include research papers???)

**As for TA, your view of holding for the long-term is spot on. It's what I practice as well.**

Even though I can just wait for signs of strength, buy on confirmation, sell when sign of weakness pops out following Volume Spread Analysis...the problem is that it gets FUCKING EXHAUSTING. 

I'd have to stare at the chart all day long to catch the price at the confirmation, and that defeats the purpose of investing. That is the same even if I put price alerts on TradingView.

Plus, if I have to keep worrying and watching my stock, does it make it an actual good buy?

A lot of people who are new to market often have this idea that to make money in the market you need to ""goreng"", and I was definitely one of those when I first started. I must say it is definitely a viable option to make money but most of the the time you'll lose. What you make today you can lose tomorrow. Most of the work actually goes into FA ,for me atleast, and that is where the beauty lies in investing. 50% is homework. 49% is conviction & will. 1% is when you press that button to buy and sell. Just to keep it short and taking important points from what you said.

1)RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH. (HOMEWORK)
2)ALWAYS trade with money you have.

3)If you invest in fundamentally strong companies, don't lose your hair if prices fall. Be strong with your convictions and strengthen your mind & will to back your conviction. If you've done your research you know best. (DOES NOT APPLY TO GORENG STOCKS)

I find that this way of investing have been the most consistently rewarding for me. Market having a bad day? Close your app, spend time with your family, eat some good food, come back another day 2-3 months later all is good. Or just buy the dip, baby. 

I must say I disagree when it comes to O&G. I still see a future even with the upcoming of alternative energy sources. Unlike coal, oil&gas is still very versatile in its functionality. Also, must consider the rate of development in terms of infrastructure for electric transportation. When will we see charging stations at the same rate we see petrol stations in Malaysia, or the world? In the UK itself they have a very hard time in implementing infrastructure. No doubt it will come soon but when? Ofcourse, it is up to debate as these are just my opinions and very simplified at that as my thumbs are getting tired lol.

7433,7507,"Another informative article! Good on ya mate. 

On the topic of future energy trends, I would like to humbly add 3 points to it.

1) Oil I believe is a sunset industry, though even then, not in the next 5 years as the vehicles and infra around it are not ready to transition out. Further, oil is a major revenue generator for petronas, so, doubt the country will be willing to accelerate killing the golden goose just yet until petronas is able to transition themselves to different sources of revenue.

However, gas is an energy source that will blossom in the next 5 to 20 years. Its considered a 'cleaner' source of energy compared to other carbon based and there is an abundance of cheap supply. Hence you see capital investments in gas ramping up past few years including from petronas.
 
Renewable sources will continue to grow tremendously, but if you look at the sheer scale of energy needs and how much proportion is renewables, it will take a long long while more before energy hungry nations can shutter their dependence on carbon based sources.

2) So if we talk about the future sources of energy and future trends in mobility, agree with your assessment of where battery tech is evolving. Hydrogen is also a trend that is accelerating albeit very much still in the development stage.

What does it mean for investors? Besides the obvious names like Tesla and Panasonic etc, consider the less obvious names like the chinese EV carmakers as they are accelerating EV development too. 

Also consider the wider supply chain ecosystem for investment ideas. What are the non-sexy supporting industries? For EVs, highly dependent on semiconductors. Hence continued boom for semicon counters? Also, who is leading the charging station push. Will we see the end of a petrol station as we know it? For batteries, what raw materials are required? Even for utility players and power gen players, will we see unprecedented demand growth since more and more sectors transition to electricity as their power source? Lots of opportunities out there i reckon üòÅ

I've done some work on second-life EV batteries for stationary storage applications and my biggest concern with Li-Cycle would actually be access to batteries to recycle. The cell manufacturers typically have a boiler plate agreement to take back their battery modules at end of life. Most EV companies (excluding Tesla) are unlikely to bring cell manufacturing in house so I'd be suspicious of Li-Cycle getting access to that 'manufacturing scrap' they call out on slide 13.

7474,7679,"Hey there, thank you for visiting the sub.

During this difficult time you may be looking information about what the NIPT results you received mean. There are 2 main sticky posts about what NIPT is, how it works, what it can miss and how false positives happen, sono findings, and your chances of a true positive after NIPT.
POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE CALCULATOR FOR NIPT RESULTS https://www.perinatalquality.org/Vendors/NSGC/NIPT/

*I highly suggest you first read through everything in main post located here to start:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NIPT/comments/ecjj5v/welcome_to_rnipt_the_sub_for_abnormal_nipt/

*After this head over to this post about the actual individual results:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NIPT/comments/itmyjw/my_nipt_results_show_this_abnormality_what_does/


Please also place a flair on your username which can be done by going to the right side of the sub -- community options -- and update username flair. This updates the flair on your username IN THIS SUB ONLY. This is so when you speak to others, they immediately understand your situation AND you can see their situation summary. There are some options filled in, but you can also write in your own result.


Please place POST FLAIR on your actual post. These are in different colors and allows users to actually click on the post flair and pull up every post that has a similar situation such as -no results-trisomy 13-NT scan question-etc. Clicking on the green -no result post flair- will bring up everyone who has also tagged their submission as no results/low fetal fractions and you can read up their stories/outcomes and responses (or any other topic that is common for NIPT results.


Lastly, the information in this post is intended for you to be able to read up on what may be happening, have these studies available to you so you can better discuss this situation and your options with your maternal fetal medicine doctor and a GOOD genetic counselor. You always have a right to speak to a genetic counselor after an abnormal NIPT result and this should be provided for you by your OB. If you have been incorrectly told that the accuracy of your result is 99% without a proper Predictive Value calculation please report this somewhere as this actually leads to wrongful terminations of pregnancies in that office. That OB needs further education about NIPT positives and how to present such information as well as knowledge of the Positive Predictive Value of NIPT based on age. You could make a big difference by making sure this never happens again in the OB's office for future patients such as yourself.


As always, take any information given here and online for what it is - information - and always discuss further treatment plans with your physicians, however with caution. Not all physicians are actually up to date with NIPT testing, what results mean or how to present such SCREENING results to a patient. You will see this come up in posts across this sub.


My intention is that you have as much information about what may be going on and can make informed decisions with your treatment team moving forward.


THIS IS A SCREENING AND NOT A DIAGNOSTIC TEST

So the fundamentals looked relatively solid on this.  However, I couldn't really understand their market price in relation to their operating performance UNTIL I took a look at the history of jet fuel prices.

Like most air travel/cargo companies, Atlas Air's stock market price is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in jet fuel prices which are historically pretty volatile.

That and on any given day, fewer than 1M shares tend to trade hands on this $1.8B company (small cap).... so there isn't a lot of buffer to make this investment grade in my view... it's more of a highly speculative gamble.  Even excluding the pandemic, they move +/- 20-40% in a month.  That's quite volatile.

The humour is extremely nonexistent, and with a solid grasp of FACTS and LOGIC most of the political analysis will go under a typical viewer's head. There's also Dave‚Äôs classical liberal outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from whoever is paying him the most money, for instance. The fans don‚Äôt understand this stuff; they lack the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the grift, to realise it‚Äôs not just sad- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who like Dave Rubin truly ARE idiots- of course they would appreciate, for instance, the humour in Dave's existential catchphrase ""AOC=NPC,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to the fact that the Left hates gamers because they get shit done.

One thing I did not see mentioned previously was transportation. I'm not an expert on steel but I've been in transportation for about a decade so have handled many steel commodities. I currently am seeing a surge in these commodities. Here is what I'm seeing overall. This is not financial advice.

Ports: [https://imgur.com/9II5b6S](https://imgur.com/9II5b6S)  
\-Earlier this month various U.S. ports are incredibly backed up. Shown is an example of Long Beach, CA which had as of Feb 1st. over 40 vessel waiting to be anchored for discharge. Not shown is a similar situation in the ports of Oakland, Savannah to name a few. Huge amounts of demand that will affect the bottom line. Which ties into my next point, transportation.

Transport: [https://imgur.com/j9gAcol](https://imgur.com/j9gAcol)  
\-Example of 2017 to 2018 spot market pricing of flatbeds. Vans looked similar in this time frame as well. I took another closer look at a common steel lane over the last 12 months and to no surprise here are the results ([https://imgur.com/a0IE4Mb](https://imgur.com/a0IE4Mb)). This is driven by demand and the rising fuel prices, my next point.

Oil: [https://imgur.com/IrIar7h](https://imgur.com/IrIar7h)  
\-5 Year plot of diesel pricing, as you all know already which way oil has been trending as of late so I won't go into this further.

My personal belief is we are not wrong, we may be early or right on time. The data tells me we may have another 2018 or greater situation on our hands. Some catalysts that could really explode this would be increased travel with vaccines now out and of course the big infrastructure plan we're all hoping to hear later this month.

7915,9550,"Congrats on graduation.

You put a lot of technical work in which is great! I think the best way to grasp knowledge you learn from the classroom is to get out there and start making analyses ASAP.

I skimmed over most of it and I have some advice: going forward, try to isolate the key factors driving your thesis and focus on those. I know you probably worked very hard putting all this technical work on paper, but a large portion of this is not really necessary and doesn't add much insight. You may be missing the forest for the trees a bit. 

You would get a MUCH greater return on your time if you get down to the 2-3 variables that truly matter for an investment and digging deep on those. Most often these variables have a qualitative aspect that will infer what ROIIC and reinvestment will look like 5+ years down the line.

In short, I would spend less time calculating 500 different ratios and more time looking at the handful of factors (these differ on a case by case basis) that drive 80% of price movement.

Edit: I should add that it is perfectly fine to look at some of these measures if they help you understand the company and shed light on the key drivers, but when communicating your thesis it is best to triage and focus on what matters most.",congrat graduation put lot technical work great think good way grasp knowledge learn classroom get start make analysis asap skim advice go forward try isolate key factor drive thesis focus those know probably work hard put technical work paper large portion really necessary add much insight may miss forest tree bit would get much great return time get 23 variable truly matter investment dig deep those often variable qualitative aspect infer roiic reinvestment look like 5 year line short would spend less time calculate 500 different ratio time look handful factor these differ case case basis drive 80 price movement edit add perfectly fine look measure help understand company shed light key driver communicate thesis good triage focus matter most,120,0.2727272727272727,0.09166666666666666,2020-06-17 02:25:28,1,esg-bullish

8077,10332,"There are problems with expanding SNAP, TANF, and other welfare programs.

1. It doesn‚Äôt have support from Republicans. UBI is a fairer alternative because it doesn‚Äôt specifically favor one group of people.

2. The penetration rate of welfare programs is horrifically low. There are 30M adults living in poverty, only 20M are covered by SNAP, only 2M participate in TANF. The bureaucracy is built to keep people from claiming benefits. Depending on the program and state, up to 98% of needy applicants are denied.

3. Welfare incentivizes staying in welfare, because additional income works against the welfare benefits. And it‚Äôs difficult to get your welfare back when income drops back down.

4. Welfare isn‚Äôt even that much. Average 2 adult household on SNAP gets $400. Average TANF gets $400. Out of 30M families in poverty, only 2M get anywhere close 1000 in benefits. 18M get $127 of SNAP, and 10M adults get nothing.

If you think the Roosevelt Institute‚Äôs estimates are too high, then you can look at SNAP. Enter the Department of Agriculture, which studied the effects of SNAP, a cash-like welfare program that gives 40M Americans living in poverty around $127 a month for food. They found that GDP increased by $1.5-1.8B for every billion dollars distributed. Furthermore, the study indicates that for every billion dollars of SNAP, between 9k-13K jobs were created. The authors claim SNAP had a better impact on the economy than tax cuts and other economic stimulus programs. SNAP is not a perfect model for UBI, as it restricts purchases to food only, the primary beneficiaries are food companies, targets only 15% of the US population, and infuses the economy with way less money, but has a successful track record of being a powerful economic stimulus via cash assistance.

I understand the multiplier is not as high as 2.5, but a 2.0 GDP multiplier on cash assistance spent is reasonable. So $3T spent on the Freedom Dividend results in an estimated GDP increase of $6T. That‚Äôs not bad.

 The Freedom Dividend benefits low-income households

* Households in the bottom nine deciles see their disposable income rise about $10,000 on average, while households in the top decile lose an average of $8,000.
*  This represents a highly progressive outcome, more than doubling the average disposable income of households in the bottom decile and reducing top-decile incomes by about 4 percent. 
*  Overall, 86 percent of people would come out ahead, though 10 to 15 percent of each income group up to $200,000 would come out behind (these are mostly non-citizens).
*  Almost all households earning more than $500,000 would pay more in taxes than they‚Äôd receive from the Freedom Dividend. 

That aside, I still support reforming our right wing welfare state. The [House Bill to Reauthorize TANF Makes Improvements But Doesn‚Äôt Go Far Enough](https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/house-bill-to-reauthorize-tanf-makes-improvements-but-doesnt-go-far).

¬†A bill[\[1\]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/house-bill-to-reauthorize-tanf-makes-improvements-but-doesnt-go-far#_ftn1) to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program that House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady and Human Resources Subcommittee Chair Adrian Smith introduced on May 17 makes some improvements in TANF, but doesn‚Äôt go far enough. ¬†On the positive side, it holds states accountable for TANF recipients‚Äô employment outcomes and begins to constrain how they use federal block grant funds (and, to a lesser degree, state TANF funds).¬† **On the negative side, it adds no new money to the TANF block grant, which has been funded at the same level since 1996 and has lost almost 40 percent of its value due to inflation, even as the number of poor children remains roughly unchanged.** ¬†The bill also fails to hold states accountable for assisting families in need, and it maintains important elements of TANF‚Äôs rigid work requirements, albeit with more options for how participants can meet them.

More specifically, the bill:

* **Leaves the amount of the block grant frozen and eliminates the TANF Contingency Fund.**¬† While the bill leaves both the amount and the allocation of the federal block grant unchanged, all states would see a small reduction in their block grant due to the creation of a new technical assistance fund.¬† (An earlier draft of the bill included a provision to reallocate part of the block grant funding based on states‚Äô child poverty rates, but this is not in the bill that was introduced.)¬† The bill also eliminates the $608 million Contingency Fund and shifts the funds to child care.
* **Requires specified spending levels in ‚Äúcore‚Äù areas.**¬† The bill requires states to spend 25 percent of their federal and state TANF funds on a core set of activities intended to support work and provide basic assistance to families.¬† **A core spending requirement is a positive step, as one of TANF‚Äôs biggest failures in its first three decades has been states‚Äô large-scale diversion of TANF funds away from core welfare reform activities and toward other areas, often unrelated to helping the poorest families find work or meet their basic needs. ¬†However, the bill sets the requirement at too low a level:¬† only five states don‚Äôt currently meet the 25 percent threshold.¬† More importantly, states that spend just 25 percent of TANF funds on basic assistance and employment-related programs and supports typically serve only a small fraction of low-income families with children.**¬† A better strategy would be to gradually increase this threshold over the next several years to 35 percent ‚Äî at this level, 20 states would have to raise their spending on these core areas ‚Äî and require states to target those funds to families receiving income assistance through TANF.
* **Limits state spending in specified areas.**¬† In order to increase accountability for federal funds, the bill prohibits states from directly spending federal TANF funds on child care and child welfare services or activities.¬† Instead, it allows them to transfer up to 50 percent of their federal TANF funds to federal programs that provide these activities and services and to Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).¬† The transfer for child welfare is limited to 10 percent of a state‚Äôs federal block grant amount. ¬†Currently, between a third and half of the states (depending on what is included) spend more than 10 percent of their federal TANF funds on child welfare; three states spend more than 50 percent on child care.¬† (Data are not available to assess the impact of the WIOA transfer.)¬† **The bill imposes no limits on the use of** ***state*** **TANF funds for these activities and services, so states may be able to shift their federal and state spending, reducing the provision‚Äôs potential impact.**
* **Limits TANF spending to families below 200 percent of poverty.**¬† The bill requires states to spend all federal and state TANF dollars on families with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty line.¬† **Current rules require states to spend TANF funds on ‚Äúneedy‚Äù families, but states define ‚Äúneedy‚Äù and may provide people over 200 percent of poverty with some services, such as college scholarship programs and pre-K programs.¬† The proposed change would better target the funds, but likely will have a limited impact in most states.**
* **Holds states accountable for employment-related outcomes instead of participation in work activities.**¬† The bill replaces TANF‚Äôs work participation rate with four outcome measures related to recipients‚Äô employment, job retention, earnings, and attainment of a high school diploma or the equivalent (for parents under age 24).¬† It requires states to meet negotiated targets in all four areas starting in 2020.¬† (States would face a loss of federal block grant funds if they fail to meet the targets.)¬† This positive change should enable states to focus less on process ‚Äî that is, getting people into activities that count toward meeting the work participation rate ‚Äî and more on helping parents with diverse needs find and maintain employment.¬† An important omission, however, is the lack of a performance measure related to program access.¬† **The share of poor families with children that receive TANF has plummeted since the mid-1990s, which has left many families without basic assistance** ***or*** **employment services.¬† Without an access measure, states could improve their performance on the bill‚Äôs employment-related targets by keeping the most disadvantaged families out of the program entirely.¬† TANF will never realize its full potential if it doesn‚Äôt serve families in need in the first place.**
* **Maintains rigid work requirements, though with more work activity options.**¬† The bill requires states to conduct an assessment and develop an employment and service plan for all work-eligible TANF recipients.¬† While it recognizes a broader range of work activity options and removes the current restrictions on participation in education and training programs,¬†it maintains rigid weekly hourly participation requirements of 20 or 30 hours for most parents.¬† **These requirements are costly to implement, ill-suited for many families, and inconsistent with the bill‚Äôs universal engagement approach.¬† By holding states accountable for participants‚Äô employment outcomes, the bill provides ample incentives for them to tailor participation requirements to families‚Äô circumstances so states succeed in helping parents find jobs; there is no need for a cumbersome, rigid hours requirement.**

Despite its positive features, the bill does not directly address some of TANF‚Äôs fundamental flaws.¬† TANF remains a block grant that does not rise and fall over time with need.¬† When the next recession hits, TANF will almost certainly fail to respond to increases in unemployment and hardship, just as it failed to respond during the last recession.[\[2\]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/house-bill-to-reauthorize-tanf-makes-improvements-but-doesnt-go-far#_ftn2)¬† **TANF‚Äôs block grant structure also incentivizes states to serve as few families as possible, enabling them to serve just a tiny fraction of the families in need of assistance.**

TANF was created with the promise that states, with greater flexibility (in at least in some areas), could do a better job of assisting families when they hit on hard times.¬† Instead, they have used the flexibility they were given to fund state priorities in lieu of core income assistance and employment programs, leaving too many of the poorest families to fend for themselves.¬† **The bill takes some steps to limit state flexibility and redirect some federal funds to TANF‚Äôs core purposes, but only a major overhaul that recognizes the individual needs of each struggling family and prioritizes the goal of reducing poverty and deep poverty among children would truly fix TANF.**

8095,10434,"I too have an interest in economics side of things, and will attempt to answer the economics part of it. I'll leave the social aspects to others, but i will say that almost a quarter of people who qualify for welfare do not get it for various reasons (bureaucracy, stigma, etc..) while a UBI will almost single-handedly eliminate poverty by its very definition. 

There have been many, many UBI pilots which have been done (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic\_income\_pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots)), as far as I know none of them shown any reduction in employment (except for mothers with newborn babies which in this case I think having them look after their child is probably more productive to society in the long-term compared to having them working a min wage job and neglecting their child)

Yang's UBI is actually half deficit funded (notice the line item called economic growth? the spending comes first, the economic growth comes later - basically the economic growth line item is equal to the amount of deficit spending), hence the GDP growth numbers are in fact, realistic (not 12% but more like 8% if we're interpolating, that's 8% over 8 years which is an additional 1% per year, which are very achievable numbers). In comparison, we have deficit financed tax deductions for the rich without much to show for GDP growth under Trump...

A $1000/mth UBI will absolutely supercharge the local economy and create millions of jobs (if you look at the Roosevelt study it clearly says this) in itself. This (in addition to the $12k/mth UBI) helps displaced workers transition to the new economy. Furthermore, there's many other beneficial side effects like reducing poverty-related crimes, abortions, suicides, drug abuse, incarceration rates which the Roosevelt study doesn't even begin to take into account.",interest economic side thing attempt answer economic part it ill leave social aspect other say almost quarter people qualify welfare get various reason bureaucracy stigma etc ubi almost singlehandedly eliminate poverty definition many many ubi pilot done see httpsenwikipediaorgwikibasic_income_pilotshttpsenwikipediaorgwikibasic_income_pilots far know none show reduction employment except mother newborn baby case think look child probably productive society longterm compare work min wage job neglect child yang ubi actually half deficit fund notice line item call economic growth spending come first economic growth come later basically economic growth line item equal amount deficit spending hence gdp growth number fact realistic not 12 like 8 be interpolate that s 8 8 year additional 1 per year achievable number comparison deficit finance tax deduction rich without much show gdp growth trump 1000mth ubi absolutely supercharge local economy create million job if look roosevelt study clearly say this itself in addition 12kmth ubi helps displace worker transition new economy furthermore there s many beneficial side effect like reduce povertyrelated crime abortion suicide drug abuse incarceration rate roosevelt study even begin take account,177,-0.6470588235294118,0.096045197740113,2020-01-28 00:09:25,-1,esg-bearish

8098,10451,"Hi, if possible I would like to discuss these papers you have linked in detail.

I would like to appoint out few assumptions made here:

\-Cost benefit analysis of current welfare have drawbacks of excluding population which did not participate or failed the prerequisite conditions. Does not address effective of welfare trap.

\-Canada and other countries have similar levels of unemployment insurance comparable to $1000 a month. However 12k a year is not meant to replace your income, it simply meant a source as transition period. You can read up on arguments on unemployment insurance.

\-Do we really understand what it is like to be extreme poor?

I skimmed through Brooking studies Page 13, first half of page 14 found:

>  A UBI or UBI-style proposal in response to these wage and employment trends would do nothing to address their underlying causes... so these estimates also appear ill-equipped to address current proposals.

The first paragraph cited above makes bode claims that UBI does not address underlying cause. The paper did not ever mention why these declining trends are occurring, but simply cites them in few other studies, then makes the above claim. It fails argue that how UBI will not be effectively addressing underlying cause of an increasingly obsolete workforce facing technological change. Instead, it dances around the issue by citing more studies that argue on similar unrelated policies in isolation.

\-Payroll subsidies does not account for none working force. Which injection of free money transfer would achieve.

\-Skill enhancement from UBI and lowered labor participation rate in THAT category is overall positive.

\-Net effect on labor is still largely unclear. Low-skill labor does not have place in the CURRENT economy, however the UBI infused economy and the economical effects of monetary expansion in desolated areas would create more low-skill service focused jobs.

1) UBI will be paid out monthly instead of annually like EITC. This makes a huge difference in QOL for people who are struggling since expenses are incurred monthly not annually.

2) It sounds like one of your major concerns is that UBI will cause a decline in labor force participation. But the entire premise behind a UBI being necessary is precisely because automation will force people out of jobs, whether they like it or not. We are about to see our employment rate and labor force participation fall precipitously in 5-10 yrs. Assuming that you find this automation threat credible, I really only see 2 solutions to address the transition period between job displacement and new job creation by the emerging technologies: UBI or FJG. So we either 1) cut everyone a basic stipend, while incentivizing them to still be productive to society through other social programs and let them decide for themselves what meaningful work to pursue or 2) let the government create all the jobs. I personally am firmly in camp #1.

8189,10975,"Solid DD but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the cost side of this business. Now, I haven't read anything from SPH to know the answers to my concerns but I've done some investing in propane businesses in the past so these are all risks we've talked about in the past. 

Every extra trip that SPH has to take negatively impacts its margins. These businesses win by maximizing route costs since demand is almost entirely exogenous and, frankly, declining at a macro level as customers adopt natural gas and electric heat. In other words, if you can perfectly model your routes to fill up all of the neighboring tanks in one go and then do it again in a few months, then you're doing well. But if this spike in demand is causing the company to modify their routes in a less efficient way to avoid losing angry customers, then they're going to get hit hard on the bottom line even with growth in sales.

These businesses also maintain contracts with the midstream guys to buy a certain quantity of propane per year at a certain price. If they're buying more propane than normal, they're paying the price for it. And these businesses have killed it recently by lowering prices at a slower rate than their input costs and taking the additional spread as margin. Anytime gas costs rise, they can't raise prices to capture that same margin plus their delivery costs go up.

Also, commercial propane margins are ass. I wouldn't put too much stock into outdoor propane heating. The interesting thing is that residential propane is taking share from commercial, which could be a boon if the cost side didn't get fucked in the process. Can't discount the warm weather, which could have a huge impact.

Last thing: I'm not totally positive but I feel like I remember hearing that Suburban (and all the majors in general) are shedding customers organically, either to natural gas / electric or to lower cost regional competitors. So that's another concern if customers have become more price conscious by spending more time at home. Maybe they've negotiated prices down or moved to someone else.

1. Always start with W, every time the adc goes to last hit, W him/her, position yourself so that it will hit Enemy ADC, heals you, then hits enemy support. Makes for good trades early.

2. If you have the ADC on comms (Skype/discord/etc) Coordinate with them so that when the enemy support goes in for a relic shield proc, or enemy adc goes to last hit a cannon minion, you E your ADC, causing their attacks to do more damage and slow, as soon as the first empowered auto lands, THEN bubble. A slow target is much easier to bubble then a target uninhibited.

3. When escaping from a bad situation early game, chances are you have boots, and your ADC does not, cast E on the ADC to speed them up (passive). As a bonus, if the ganker you are running from gets close enough, W yourself to speed yourself, causing a bounce to the enemy, then to your ADC.

4. Your ult, is just the silliest thing alive (1/3rd a lane wide, knock up and travels to Narnia), however don't use it in the first second or two of a fight, most people with channeled abilities will wait before dumping their full kit, this is the time to get a tidal wave of interrupts.

5. To be the biggest fish in the sea, get Frost Queens claim, this item alone will set up so many easy bubbles, and cause flashes faster then rammus rolling through a lane.

- When you're ahead and trying to force a fight on an enemy playing safe, use your E to spawn a plant to slow them and then use that to follow up with your QWR one shot. Many people think they have to use their E for the snare but the slow it gives is quite handy before getting a Rylais.

8263,11454,"Nice read :)

Some additions :

* ***Alistar*** : 

    Flash-Q-W into your tower. Do this if the enemy harasses you under tower as they will draw tower aggro. You can also do this if the enemy's last minion is getting killed by your tower in the next moments so the tower will attack them. 

* ***Bard*** :

    Looking forward to the guide. Just wanted to say it's often safer to Q-AA in order to proc TLD but it's easier if you AA-Q due to the slow.

* ***Braum*** : 

    If the enemy ADC is attacking your tower, minions under tower or even you under your tower, raise your shield. It will absorb the damage **and** make the tower aggro on the enemy

* ***Janna*** :

    Never waste your W to poke. It doesn't do that much damage for the mana cost and movement debuff. Use E on your ADC when his Attack is mid-air to increase the uptime and ultimately the damage output. Spare your Q, don't try to poke with it ever. Your Q is your only disengage tool if shit goes wrong. You can stop every dash with it (Leona E, Lee Q etc...) so try to anticipate this kind of stuff to deny the enemy.

8267,11488,"##**Braum, the Heart of the Freljord**

#*Build*

Braum's the best with lots of Health and Armor, with spare amounts of MR, as any tank. Here's my build that often works the best.


I always start the game with a relic shield and 3 biscuits, but you can sub 2 out for a vision ward.

I usually don't back until I have enough for Sapphire Sightstone, then boots. Or if I have enough, Targon's Brace. Rest on wards/potions.

After this I try to rush the Face of the Mountain and Frozen Heart.

Next up is mercury treads and trying to finish Ruby Sightstone for health.

Afterwards, if the team has any really important MR, it's Banshee's Veil. If you've gotten far enough without it, Titanic Hydra. Health 4 Lyf.

Lastly, Banshee's Veil or Righteous Glory, but games usually don't last that long ;)

#*Tips*

1) Use your W on Braum to bait an enemy to chase you with low health! Simply make sure you have an ally ready to murdilate the enemy!

2) Braums E gives Movespeed, useful for chasing and landing a Q!

3)Braums basic combo (for saving) is W+E, and can quickly turn a fight around if you ult+Q+whatever!

4)Braum does a shit ton of damage for a tank support! His passive gives him bonus damage on hit after procing!

5)A great level 2 combo to surprise the enemy is W+Q!


6)If facing an enemy such as Master Yi or Fizz, the best thing to is to wait AFTER their untargettable ability, then ult!

7)Braums W gives a portion of his MR and Armor!

8)Titanic Hydra can help proc your passive better!

10)Braums ult also knocks up all enemies around him in a very short radius! And slows!

11)Braums E NEGATES all damage on the first hit, use it to avoid certain fatal attacks!

12)If you W in front of an enemy ADC, put your E up and force them out of position!

13)Your W automatically puts you between your ally and your enemy!

#*Laning*

Braum works best offensively, often taking the enemy by surprise and setting up lots of CC and procing his passive as often as possible. See to it you're always between your enemy and your adc, to save you time and mana, as you don't have to w often.

You can often bait out assassins by engaging a fight, then using your w and Face of The Mountain on your carry.

Deny your enemy creepscore by using your E, or by positioning yourself to get a Free Q off on them.

You can go in on an ADC with a Q+AA combo, and W back to your ADC to engage their support instead. Using your E to block the ADC.

ALWAYS max Q first. You have sustain on W and speedup on E but your main purpose in lane is bullying people.

Powerchord is an AA reset. Q once in fountain, once when leashing then go into lane AA -> Q -> powerchord AA = early lane control.

Always contest enemy melee support when he goes for his relic proc. Always punish low range enemy adc for last hits.

passive-aggressive harass = Q on both enemy champs when it's up 2x, then do AA+Q+powerchordAA combo. (When they start to expect this switch it up)

Unexpected, nearly impossible to avoid powerchord:
E or W into E or W into AA+Q+powerchordAA

The threat of your ultimate is at times alot more potent than the actual useage of it. Don't throw it willy-nilly

LEARN TO POSITION YOURSELF! You're squishy as f... You don't have any mobility outside flash. You WILL be targeted if out of position. Use this fact to your advantage.

Your level 6 all in is strong. but only if your ADC knows how to play.

DON'T BE SCARED TO TAKE KILLS.

In the meantime, here's some Janna tips:

1)  You can self-shield (alt-E) and poke the enemy with your own aa.  The damage early on is scary good, AND your passive makes it easy for your adc to follow up.

2)  If you are aiming an offensive Q, aim a little right or left of the champion you want to hit.  You can often get a full charge (or close) tornado off that way, and most players instinctively dodge when they see the tornado charging.

3)  Your ult can heal over walls/obstructions.  Especially good when the enemy is fighting, thinking they have a favorable situation, not knowing you're on the other side of a wall, healing your teammate(s) until it's too late.

4)  Ardent Censer is really great on Janna, particularly if you have a Varus/Kog/Vayne to support.  Also, your ult + Censer can enable your entire team to tank a turret and quickly kill it with no minion support.  (That's a move my group and I have used to turn around a few tough stalemates by ninja-ing a base turret even when lane isn't pushed.  Janna's passive also helps with that.)   Captain's Boots are very nice on her as well.

Trundle : 

 1. Your Q literally steals AD from whoever you decide to bite, meaning you can use it offensively and defensively. Furthermore, it's an auto-attack reset, so remember that to sneak in extra damage when you're trading.

 2. Your W is a very useful ability even as a support since it allows you to gain some speed and extra damage, remember to save it for longer trades/skirmishes. Just like Thresh's ""backward lantern"" or Bard's ""Magical Journey"", it can be used as bluffing tool, to make believe the enemy laner that you're going to engage, forcing them to back off. Last but not least, Frozen Domain gives you more health received from all sources, which might not seem like a big deal when you're playing as support, but wait until you get a Grasp of the Undying proc while on your frozen domain, you'll feel the difference!

 3. Your E counts as terrain (Lucian can dash through it, mind you), meaning that you can block off some paths, but remember that it's better to make the enemy try to squeeze through a small space (while being slowed, mind you) instead of just putting your pillar right up against the wall. Also, slowing someone with a pillar counts as an assists, just letting you know.

 4. Your ult allows you to make someone squishy, which is very valuable against tanks and the like. But it also heals you, meaning that using your Frozen Domain right as you pick your target will allow you to get more health back! Do remember that your ultimate can be countered by a QSS, meaning you'll need to put more thought into who to ult and when : Do you want your ult to be QSS'd so that another important CC or debuff can be applied ? Or do you want to wait until the QSS is used to use your ultimate ? Yet another reason for you to pay attention to the scoreboard every minute or so!

 5. When it comes to leveling abilities, the match-up is an important factor to consider : Is the enemy support also melee ranged ? Can they make it difficult for you to use your Q ? My safe choice is to take Q at level one to secure the Relic Shield charges & leash for jungler, then pillar at level 2, then frozen domain. Maxing order (for me) is usually R > E (Pillar) > Q (Chomp) > W (Frozen Domain)


Bard :

 1. Your passive makes it so that chimes will spawn a little bit before jungle camps, meaning you should pay attention to the minimap while you're waiting for the jungle camps to spawn in order to acquire 2 early chimes, should their location not be dangerous for you to reach.

 2. Your Q gives you a ridiculous amount of pressure early game : the range is very tricky and hard to predict when you're on the receiving end, especially around minions, so use it ! That spell is the only reason a lot of people take ignite with Bard, a simple AA + Q + AA combo will proc thunderlord, applying a lot of damage and likely force a heal and/or flash, meaning your ignite is very threatening.

 3. Your W is a pretty lackluster heal in the heat of the moment (though the movement speed can make or break some engage!), but don't forget to let a shrine or two chill back behind your turret just in case you end up needing it.

 4. Your E is a really good and unique spell in terms of the utility you can bring to your entire team but you should be wary of where you're sending your teammates and yourself. It's very easy for an enemy to get his spell rotation ready if he sees you coming! On the other hand, if an enemy is chasing you through a tunnel of yours, remember to let them have a taste of your cosmic binding (Q) right as they come out : It's the easiest way for you to land your stun, and cut a chase short! It's possible for you to [use your Magical Journey to travel from the fountain to the Top/Bot inhibitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFk8ypecPls) with a bit of tricky aiming down/up the wall!

 5. Your ult can be very tricky to aim when you're not sure how the enemy will react: some targets will have a dash or gap-closer to get away, some might blow their flash to be safe, and some might just be helpless. One thing you need to remember is that your ult has a travel time at long distances and people will always know where it lands (though being on the very border of the ult can be hit or miss), meaning you can create pressure when a fight breaks out or there's a chase in the jungle. A *very* situational trick you can use is ulting a teammate of yours that just used their Zhonya's Hourglass while being surrounded with enemies that are just waiting to kill your golden statue of a teammate. Doing that will cause the enemies to be stuck in the stasis from your ult while your teammate will be completely safe because he wasn't affected by your ult, being in his own stasis.

1. Pillar of Ice can cancel channeled abilities or displacements. A pillar's knockup on Blitzcrank or an ally will [stop a hook dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GdTCMhHCpQ). The same goes for charges from [Sion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MslY9a8RKOQ) or Vi, [Gragas' dash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAQLMkRP9So), Katarina's ult, and so on. Lots of opportunity to shut down engages or waste a jungler's time.
2. Pillar can safely check bushes, regardless of size. It grants vision and most champs won't be able to make a play once knocked up or slowed anyway.
3. For best results, pillar near walls, narrow passageways, and [turret bases](https://youtu.be/VkcWHhyyWDs?t=519). Time spent awkwardly bypassing a pillar is time spent taking free damage. [Great pillars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvBXHwfPzSo) can leave somebody pinned and helpless.
4. Want to knock a target back into your team? Aim Pillar slightly ahead of that target. Champs can be likewise be knocked away or to the sides.
5. Use Domain (`W`) before ulting to increase self-healing. If the target is Leona, Rammus, or someone else with a resistance boosting ability, ulting after that ability is used will steal extra stats.

8339,12100,"General:

  1. When trying to land any kind of skill shot watch your creeps + wait for the enemy to last hit them. They may move randomly in lane, but will always go for last hits, which makes them predictable. This takes some timing to get right, and knowledge of the enemy's range to know where they'll stop to auto. 
  2. You can do the same thing I wrote above to trade autos (even as support). Either the enemy gives up cs to auto back or they take free damage.
  3. When trying to land a line skill shot (like a hook) watch the enemy creeps' health. People are scared of getting hooked so they tend to hide behind creeps, but most of the time they won't move until it's already dead. If you time your skill shot so it lands just after a creep dies most players won't be ready.


Bard:

  1. You can start W and set up shrines in the bot jungle or lane, back for mana, and get back to leash in time. Then trade with autos and push the lane, since most fights won't start until lvl 2, and you'll have your Q then.
  2. To escape you can make a portal and ult on top of yourself and your pursuers as you click the portal. Depends on timing but you can usually get through without being hit by the ult (or go through the portal while invulnerable, essentially letting you move while ulted).


Nami:

  1. Like Janna, you can use E on your adc while their auto is mid-air. Helps for chasing and trading (especially when your adc doesn't know to auto when you E them).
  2. If you have some extra mana or a lot of mana-regen you can use your abilities on a teammate or yourself get to lane faster.
  3. Your ult gives double the regular movespeed from your passive, so while it's not worth ulting your teammate (and no enemies) just to speed them up, it can be useful to land over teammates too. 
  4. Try to slow enemies with your E or ult before using your Q.
  5. Use W on your adc when they're in auto range of an enemy to get a bounce in for trading damage + healing.

+ Hopefully you already know you can eat minions and spit them back out for AOE damage.
+ Perfect the Q+W combo for if you can for grabbing minions. a) It lets you swallow a minion from a safe distance b) your swallow doesn't cost mana with his combo, so you're only using the lesser mana of your Q. Addendum: you can only use this to swallow minions.
+ This is situational, but don't always go for the swallow when your stacks are maxed. Q them for a nice 1.5sec second.
+ Basically, follow [this guy's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoakBbpqXRA). Though he uses it more for Top Kench.
+ Be wary, new Kenches, as your W can have a lot of influence in a team fight depending on who you devour and where you spit them. Kench is a champ where you have a chance of actually helping your enemy.
+ It can be tempting at first to always pop your E for the extra sustain, take note of its passive as well, which gives you TONS of health regen when you've been out of battle. However, it only heals for a percentage of your grey health. You should weigh your options if you need the extra health or the shield. If a teamfight is nearly over, sometimes popping that shield can be detrimental as it leaves you with less health after the fact.

8347,12168,"**Morgana**

&nbsp;
1. A thing I never see a Bard player do is starting with their heal. Every one starts with snare so they can win trades on lane. Though I like to start with my heal. I walk to top place a heal there, give mid a heal and give jungler a heal. This way both top and mid can stay longer on there lanes. And the jungler will be able to get a camp or 2 more before he has to back off. This is more of a prefference for me but if you like to play Bard I suggest to try both tactics(Q for own lane or heal for top/mid/jungler). 

&nbsp;
2. Use your portal to gank a lane (even your own lane). Do as if your placing a ward but instead bring your jungler with you.

&nbsp;

**Thresh**

&nbsp;
1. Your E has as passive extra damage with your basic hits so use that knowledge to poke your enemy.

&nbsp;
2. You can use your hook to escape by hooking lane monsters/jungle monster or even enemy champions.

&nbsp;
3. If you hooked someone you can use your W to let an ally get near to your enemy.

&nbsp;

**Morgana**

&nbsp;
1. Your W can be used to gain easy and fast money if you have ""Spellthief's Edge"". Just make sure you wont hit minions with it (unless you want to push your lane).

&nbsp;
2. Like said before. Do not start with building hourglass! You are a support, you need to make sure important spots are warded, so you will need a sightstone for sure. After that you can consider a hourglass but in my experience you don't always need a hourglass. I for one rarely make it to hourglass.

&nbsp;

**Taric**

&nbsp;
1. If your not fast enough in a chase but your ally is, use your W to bind to that person followed by a well aimed stun to catch the enemy.

&nbsp;
2. When using your ulti make sure that everyone gets immune.

&nbsp;
3. You can use your W multiple times on the same person even if your already linked, you can use this so your ally gets a short shield.

&nbsp;
4. Use your E to block of enemies, if you do it right you can block of enemies cause you basically have 2 stuns. The stuns will go to the direction of your mouse.

&nbsp;
5. Not really a tip or trick but more like a suggestion. I like to buy ""Ohmwrecker"" on Taric since this item has an active which disables towers for 3 seconds. So if your enemy thinks they are safe under their tower the are mistaken. Since if you do it right you can stay and fight under their tower for over 5 seconds.

&nbsp;
6. Bind your W to the jungler if you need to help him with a pull use it on the right time so it gives him a shield + some extra armor.

&nbsp;
7. Bind your W to the jungler if he ganks your lane. Junglers are often faster then you and/or your ADC so you can use your E to stun the enemy when your jungler is attacking your enemy. *Note: Your ADC is important so make sure that you don't bind to your jungler if your ADC is dying, protect your ADC.*

&nbsp;

**Zyra**

&nbsp;
1. You can use your seeds as a very short ward(with almost no vision). *Note: after the upcoming mage update this ~~wont~~ might not work anymore.*

&nbsp;
2. Try to use your seeds right after you used Q or E. This way your enemy wont see it coming.

&nbsp;
3. Enemies want to destroy your seeds. So if your playing with a Cait you can use her traps to place your seeds safely.

&nbsp;
4. Also if an enemy tries to destroy a seed, try punish him for doing so.

&nbsp;

This are some of my tips/trick/suggestions. Hope that some one can use this. If you have something to say about it please let me know, I would love to hear some input from others.

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ccv69/when_the_synergy_hits_120/d1ibg4s

And for the Nami-ster:

1. Your basic combo is E on yourself-Q-W-AA the shit outta them. E lasts a long time (6 seconds or 3 AAs I believe) so go ham with it. Nami's a great early lane bully and I've gotten a ton of first bloods just from harass.

2. Nami's E + any sort of AA-spam adc = lovely. Cast E on an Ezreal and watch 'em go to work :D

3. An obvious one, but one that people forget - Q is slow to land and fairly obvious where it's going to land, so when being aggressive (e.g. you're moving forward to land) always target it slightly behind the enemy. Particularly in low elo, adcs will move BACKWARDS to dodge instead of side to side. Same principle, if you're running away, throw it in FRONT of the people chasing you so they'll walk into it.

4. Something a lot of Nami beginners don't know is that W has a bigger BOUNCE than CAST range. So if the enemy is out of range for your cast, I'll walk forward and cast it on an ally, and sometimes it will be able to achieve the bounce.

5. Obviously Nami has good peel with R and Q, but her passive is also a peel - it increases movement speed for allies. So if you're trying to run and you don't have enough time to throw out an R/Q (R has a long channeling time, Q has a long land time), then just throw E on someone. It's instant and it costs the least mana.

6. Build CDR. You will hate yourself otherwise.

8355,12236,"More Braum/Morg/Blitz tips!

Braum:

1. His shield gives him a move-speed boost, so if you're running away from an enemy, cast the shield in the direction you're running for a boost. This way you don't become a bigger target for skillshots, but are still faster.

2. You can surprise enemy laners by jumping to an ally minion close to them, then AA>Q>AA for a quick 3 stacks of your passive and a slow. If your ADC isn't a potato, they only need one AA to proc the stun.

3. Your shield blocks all the damage of the next ability to hit you, while reducing following damage. You can use this to survive things like the Zed death mark.

Morgana:

1. I see almost all supports max their Q first, but I like to alternate it with the spellshield quite frequently vs high-cc teams, because that move is arguably your most important move as a support.

2. Stop building AP. I am guilty of this too, but your job as support Morg is not to outdamage your mid-laner. Your goal is to make picks, engage/disengage, and peel. Rush CDR, mobility, and even some tankiness. Items like Iron Locket, and rushing Frost Queens after sightstone will help your team immensely in teamfights. 

3. You can bait out important CC abilities from the enemy support (Thresh Q, Blitz Q) by standing out in the open and mindlessly auto attack a minion. They will expect an easy hook, get open, then go for you. You can immediately spellshield yourself, then go for the stun-pool and win the trade. Just keep in mind that things like the thresh hook's CD will be shorter than your spellshield since he landed it. I love doing this vs Blitz and Leona, so you can chip away at their health for the next 15s.

4. Unless your team is really far ahead, don't engage with a flash ult. As stated by others, you probably shouldn't be building Zhonya's as a support atm, and without it you will be BTFO every time you do that into 5 of them. Save your ult for chasing a couple people down, or to peel for your ADC when they get dove.

Blitz:

1. This one gets mentioned pretty frequently here, but you can bait out enemy dashes (Ezreal E) by running up to where you might land a hook, then hitting S > ctrl+4. Spamming your laugh will throw your hands out and make it look like you're gonna hook. I have this bound to a mouse-button because of how fun it is to do.

2. Another common one. The threat of a hook is often more powerful then actually using the hook. Since people can abuse the time it is down, try to zone off enemies from the creep waves by threatening your hook. I don't know how well this works at high ELO, but it's pretty effective in Silver.",braummorgblitz tip braum 1 shield give movespeed boost run away enemy cast shield direction run boost way become big target skillshot still fast 2 surprise enemy laner jump ally minion close they aaqaa quick 3 stack passive slow adc potato need one aa proc stun 3 shield block damage next ability hit you reduce follow damage use survive thing like ze death mark morgana 1 see almost support max q first like alternate spellshield quite frequently vs highcc team move arguably important move support 2 stop build ap guilty too job support morg outdamage midlaner goal make pick engagedisengage peel rush cdr mobility even tankiness item like iron locket rush frost queen sightstone help team immensely teamfight 3 bait important cc ability enemy support thresh q blitz q stand open mindlessly auto attack minion expect easy hook get open go you immediately spellshield yourself go stunpool win trade keep mind thing like thresh hook cd shorter spellshield since land it love vs blitz leona chip away health next 15s 4 unless team really far ahead engage flash ult state other probably build zhonyas support atm without btfo every time 5 they save ult chase couple people down peel adc get dove blitz 1 one gets mention pretty frequently here bait enemy dash ezreal e run might land hook hit ctrl4 spamme laugh throw hand make look like gon na hook bind mousebutton fun do 2 another common one threat hook often powerful actually use hook since people abuse time down try zone enemy creep wave threaten hook know well work high elo pretty effective silver,265,-0.5,0.07547169811320754,2016-04-25 19:48:27,-1,esg-bearish

- Lulu can hard engage with a flash + self ult. It's not as effective in a full 5 man teamfight (in soloQ), but in a 3v3 skirmish or small fight, it can be amazing.

- Make sure to W yourself or an ally when leaving base to get a little extra boost back to lane.

- If you're going to help your ADC last hit minions under tower, make sure to E something first. Otherwise when you auto a minion, your passive will hit it 3 times and the tower will end up killing it.

- If you're chasing an enemy and your ally is in front of you, you can E them, W them to speed them up, then Q off of them to catch enemies far ahead. It can also be used when escaping if your ally is behind you.

- You can bait the enemy with your R since it gives you health back. This is especially useful when under tower as you can bait them to tower dive you.

     2. You can use your seeds for vision. Place a seed in a bush and you gain vision of a small area for 60 seconds.  
     3. Don't underestimate the damage you do in lane. Zyra's Q + W combo can easily chunk out the enemy adc or squishy support. However, Zyra is extremely immobile and has very low base health, so positioning is extremely important. Getting hooked or snared in lane can lead to death very easily.

8377,12423,"o hey a support thread

With Zilean, you can double-stun and chain-CC a single target for an incredibly long time once you have some levels (namely maxed W, more levels in E is better slow)

The standard CC combo for Zilean is a simple E>Q>W>Q>E, slowing them first to land a bomb, refresh cooldowns, land second bomb and stun them, and then slow them after the stun ends so you and/or your team can keep doing damage.

The double-stun/endless CC combo for Zilean is E>Q>W>(wait)>Q>W>Q>E. This only works if you have a bit of CDR and have your W maxed, but once you meet those conditions, your W can have the perfect cooldown to be used twice in-between Qs. You start the same way with the first combo, using E to slow, land a bomb, refresh your cooldowns, and then wait 2 seconds. The bomb will keep ticking, but before it explodes, throw your second Q out to stun them once.

8381,12457,"Taric reminds me of Lulu now, in teamfights you survey your allies and help/buff the ones that need it most.

* In team fights watch allies closely for people who need heals or shields.
* In team fights, watch for and try to stun enemies that are dealing the most damage. You can stun multiple enemies if you line up you pair and yourself correctly, but if you have troubles focusing, don't panic, just aim for the ADC/damage deal er and press E.
* Don't be scared to switch pairings on the fly. If you roam, pair with the new laner. If someone leaves your range, switch to another nearby ally if you can.
* Does you tank always lead the charge? Is your jungler faster than you during chases? take advantage of this, pair with them and use your E through them to help initiate or catch foes!
* Taric's ultimate goes off much later than normal delays. My first game with him it always went off too late. Game two, I started it earlier and got the hang of it.
* A tip for Taric's ult timing is that instead of pushing R right when you know you'll need it, push it right when a situation **begins** to go sour. A lot can happen in 2.5 seconds. If you were wrong, well invulnerability never hurts.
* In my experience, even a heal with three charges heals less than you expect. using it to proc your passive is not a huge loss.
* Make use of your passive for extra damage.

For both sides, let's use the KoL as an example. The Kings of Leon NFT comes in three tiers, one of which is a digital album with ""enhanced artwork"" and physical LP record which sells for $50. The only trick is they are only selling it for two weeks so it will become a ""limited release"" and is no different than when bands would release limited editions of their albums with extra or alternative tracks. (You could even argue this is better as the problem with limited release CDs is only the owners got the hear the rare tracks as opposed to everyone.)

Also KoL is pretty big but a mid-tier band (in terms of fans) band called Portugal The Man released a $10 NFT which means they only need 100,000 fans to buy it to make $1m. So for bands hurt by non-touring due to COVID, it could be a life saver.

**Against**: The next two tiers of the KoL NFT top out at $3,000 to potentially somewhere in the millions, respectively. (The final tier is ""front row tickets for life"" and will be an auction where highest bidder wins.) Now, you could argue that the $3,000 option still only gets you the same album you can stream for free on Spotify, but otoh, it seems like something for investors, not fans. 

Also, in the press release the company running the NFT said, ""Previously, it cost $20 to go get one song"" bringing up the bad old days of a CD that had one hit and a lot of filler.

Zyra's plants do not work with lifesteal, meaning that any AA's on them do not heal the attacker. As such, plants are extremely effective at dealing with lifesteal reliant enemies such as adcs. 

Ult resets plant timers (might also heal them, not sure about that part).

Letting plants tank dragon is extremely effective as it takes him a while to kill them.

Plants prioritize: Enemies hit by the spell that summons them (first hit only), anything hit by Zyra AA, champions that are very close, closest target (including minions).

8419,12780,"Zilean Main here - though only Silver, so take my tips with a grain of salt.

1. If you're wondering what to max first and second, I would assume Zilean is the most versatile champion there is out there. If your enemy does not have the chance to dodge your bombs much, you should max Q first. Otherwise, or if you are reliant on getting your double Q for stuns, consider maxing E first.
2. A 99% point and click slow can cause tilting in itself. Only in case the enemy has a ""Can't be slowed"" or Slow Cleanse ability, you should wait for them to burn those.*
3. The ultimate catch combo: E > Q > W > Q > E. Use the first E to make your first bomb easier to land. Then use W to reset both Q and E, and instantly throw the second bomb to stun. Only after the stun has expired use E again to ensure they can't get away today!
4. It is fun to try to aim for 45% CDR; in this case, you have your ultimate up every 33 seconds.
5. Try to use your ultimate in the last second. Often times good players will just wait out until your ultimate is dropped. To pull this off effectively, you have to predict the amount of damage your enemy does; being support is a hard job. Harder than most ADCs think.
6. Don't worry about not hitting an AoE stun while in fights. Just stun someone. And don't worry about not stuning anyone: the bomb attachment is rather generous.

8433,12899,"I lux support quite a bit, I have a few tips as well. 


1. Thunderlords or windspeaker works fine. Depends what your team needs. 


2. I tend to build tanky, as all youre there for is CC. Lots of CC. I'm talking Boots of swiftness, ZZrot, Iceborne Gauntlet. Nothing is going to piss off the enemy more than trying to get to your ADC and being snared, slowed, slowed, snared; All while you keep a shield up. Late game nothing is more fun than snaring 2 enemies with a Q, then using your IBG proc to zone slow the other people trying to get your carry. How many people can boast enough CC to peel an entire team? Also, added benefit if they focus you; KITE. Youre tanky, they will waste a lot of time and cds on you. Plus, Nothing more satisfying than winning a 1v1 against their yasuo. Time your Q and IBG procs right and he will never be able to catch you. 


3. Laning phase is very similar to the other pokey supports. Use the bush, auto a lot. Save your Q for when you KNOW you can hit it. 


4. I like to use my E as a temporary ward, or to zone people towards my Q. You can always quick pop it though, if you need to. 


5. In all stages of the game, angles matter! This is why I love lux. You will rarely ever hit a Q head-on, it's too easy to dodge.Try and throw it at angles, especially in chases in lane, or in the jungle. The majority of players will not know how to dodge it, easy picks.

6. Wait to use your ult until you have applied your passive debuff. It is amazing how many people don't know lux's ult refreshes her debuff AND procs it. Once you and your adc have 6, a Q+R and a few auto's from your adc are enough to get a kill or two. 


7. Her giggle rocks.

* The first two chimes spawn at 0:35, the third chime spawns at 1:25, knowing these times is very important for the next bit.

* It's possible to semi-control where the chimes spawn depending on where you stand (as they will always spawn near Bard apart from on one occasion (next bullet point), this is very valuable because if you collect all 3 chimes, not only are you well on your way to the first 5 chimes (the meep slow) but you gain enough xp to hit level 2 at the same time as the enemy bot lane even if they are pushing for level 2 and you're not (and if you are pushing you'll hit level 2 before everyone else).

* The occasion when the chimes will not spawn near you. It is imperative that you are out of your base BEFORE the 35 second mark (preferably before the 30 second mark so you are prepared). Your base is the entire paved area surrounded by the wall and inhib towers. No chime can spawn within your base. Because of this, if you are in your base at the 35 second mark when they spawn, the chimes have a predisposition of spawning in the river, making them quite risky to get (especially if you're still in base at the 35 second mark).

The best locations to stand (this is from my experience, there may be better places) are pictured [here](http://i.imgur.com/912VCMO.jpg)].

Circles are where to stand as Bard, squares are the most probable chime spawn locations (I stress that it is not guaranteed spawn locations, just probable). 

As long as no invade happens and the chimes do spawn at these spots, you can get all 3 before your jungler needs your help on the first camp, and if the meep god is in a giving mood, your third chime will spawn where you can pick it up after helping your jungler (giving you back mana from Q).",know submission day old now bard 15 chime could detailed first two chime spawn 035 third chime spawn 125 know time important next bit possible semicontrol chime spawn depend stand as always spawn near bard apart one occasion next bullet point valuable collect 3 chime well way first 5 chime the meep slow gain enough xp hit level 2 time enemy bot lane even push level 2 and push hit level 2 everyone else occasion chime spawn near you imperative base 35 second mark preferably 30 second mark prepare base entire paved area surround wall inhib tower chime spawn within base this base 35 second mark spawn chime predisposition spawn river make quite risky get especially still base 35 second mark good location stand this experience may well place picture herehttpiimgurcom912vcmojpg circle stand bard square probable chime spawn location I stress guarantee spawn location probable long invade happen chime spawn spot get 3 jungler need help first camp meep god give mood third chime spawn pick help jungler give back mana q,172,-0.16666666666666666,0.06976744186046512,2016-04-26 23:19:28,-1,esg-bearish

1 firing q into terrain can hide the animation and increase chances of a hit

3 obvious trick, but necessary, you can fire at an angle to extend your Max range or make an enemy dodge towards you, this is great in a chase

4 you can hit multiple advancing enemies that are not in a line with q since there is a delay, this can be increased by firing on one side of an enemy to increase travel time and delay

8463,13154,"Where is Taric?

W on your melee initiator/diver for easy aoe stuns with E, then ult to save them or win a team fight once both teams are fully committed.

Time your ult to when the enemy team may not back down easily: Either your team landed your engage on them or they engaged on your team in the first place. To cover most people during your ult, it is good to W on someone in your frontline, while you stay near your backline.

You can use your ult to tower dive. Tank the first shot, ult, kill within 2,5 seconds, get out. On the other hand, your ult can save you and your adc if you get dove. You should try to stun your enemies under your tower.

Place the two stripes from E in a triangle for easy stuns.

For trades in lane, tell your adc to move in a way that helps you stun at least one person, stunning two at the same time would be fabulous.

Refresh and switch who you put your W on during a fight, depending on who needs it the most. (At the start put it on the initiator for the stun combo, later but it on a carry to peel for him.)

Use an ability between 2 aas to increase damage (his passive), good for taking towers. And don't forget to aa during fights to reduce the cooldown of your abilities.

CDR build is really good on him, so you may pull off multiple stuns during a prolonged fight and have your game changing ult on a shorter cooldown. IBG is pretty good on Taric, since it combos well with his passive.

And where is Zilean?


Zilean combo: Q, W, then place another Q on top of the last Q for a quick stun.

Place Q on your initiator, then another Q on him once he dives the enemy team, for an aoe stun on multiple enemies.

I continue to be impressed by the prolific efforts of this secretary in their remit to manage our national response to the growing climate crisis.

It is encouraging to hear that success has been found in coming to an agreement with the devolved nations on a national expansion of Plant! and I look forward to seeing the specifics of that agreement in time.

Many further measures have been outlined in the statement before us, and I must thank the secretary for giving us considerable detail to chew through about this government's plans in their portfolio. The measures outlined are all more or less agreeable in my view, though some might be benefitted by the provision of fuller evidence of the value (such as the free bussing for under 25s which the honourable member from Coalition! has raised questions about).

Some questions of my own on one of the mentioned policies, if the secretary will indulge me - they have spoken about zero-rating the purchase of electricity in industry, which is certainly an exciting idea to encourage increased electrification of steel industry and others. Do they know what this will cost, and if the zero-rating is only for industrial use how will the difference with personal use be enforced?

Additionally, have they considered offering direct subsidies to assist in acquiring the actual infrastructure to electrify these industries? I know in the example of the Port Talbot steelworks, there is an ongoing proposal to refit Electric Arc Furnaces to bring down both environmental impact and costs brought on by carbon tax, but the issue is putting together the money to buy the actual furnace, not a lack of economic incentive to switch.",deputy speaker continue impressed prolific effort secretary remit manage national response grow climate crisis encourage hear success find come agreement devolve nation national expansion plant look forward see specific agreement time many measure outline statement we must thank secretary give we considerable detail chew government plan portfolio measure outline less agreeable view though might benefitted provision full evidence value such free buss 25s honourable member coalition raise question about question one mention policy secretary indulge speak zerorating purchase electricity industry certainly exciting idea encourage increase electrification steel industry other know cost zerorating industrial use difference personal use enforce additionally consider offer direct subsidy assist acquire actual infrastructure electrify industry know example port talbot steelwork ongoing proposal refit electric arc furnace bring environmental impact cost bring carbon tax issue put together money buy actual furnace lack economic incentive switch,138,-0.058823529411764705,0.12318840579710146,2021-01-18 12:48:05,-1,esg-bearish

8479,13290,"LOLClass vid for Sona is horribly out of date.  Just realised this OP is 4months old. OK sorry, but this the following is relevant.

Not just the masteries, but the W & Q have been brought closer together in value/mana.  Q is still better HP/Mana, let alone CD, but when you go WS Keystone, *as you should*, maxing W becomes a whole lot better than it was.  Maxing W 1st prepares you for the mid game & makes your protection of your ADC less mana intensive.  Even before the recent changes, Maxing W was a legit but uncommon option for when you needed to play defensive in your early game.  At mid game, you have the mana items like Ardent Censer & Morellonomicon/Athene's Unholy Grail (I hate this item now, since it lost its mana refil on kills & assists to Morello, but some people still like it).

This is coming from a guy that would almost always max q 1st & got really mad when people thought Sona was a healer.  She wasn't, but she is now.  Sona is 2nd only to Soraka as one of the few supports you should often focus 1st.  Its because of her sustain.

Don't take my word for it.  Ask /r/Sonamains

If you take WS KS, intelligence & max your CDR - your heals @ L16 are around 3.5 seconds.  Thats a constant Armor & MR buff to your group (assuming you are tagging them with your aura).  If you take Ardent Censer - it also buffs their damage with 30magic on hit which is ok.  I can't speak for Locket at high ELO.  It was legit popular but consider just how spammy sona gets now.  It's happens every other day that I can keep my whole team alive while they wipe out the opposition without Locket, with just Max CDR, Mana Regen & AP & WS Keystone.

Unless either of your teams has their wombo combo down, the Locket is crappy.  If Wombo Combo happens, Locket is awesome & no doubt ""wins games"".  But if you are playing at low ELO & someone insists on taking Locket, thinks Ardent Censer & Morello's is ""building AP"", just block them.  Boots?+Eye or GoldItem+Sightstone, Ardent Censer & Morello hits your CDR cap & should be core.  Everything else is situational, whether it be tank, more AP or ""support items"".  If you recognise that neither team has it together enough to make Locket relevant *but you want to practice using it anyway*, thats excellent.  

Pretty much everything else is in line with /r/sonamains I think.

One thing I query which no one has even attempted to justify with Sona's current stats - why is Sorcerer Boots popular on Sona when only your Q & R are helped by it & Q isn't as big a deal as it used to be? (Assuming you don't take Nashor's).  I think Sorcerer Boots are just AP ""Conventional Wisdom"" that doesn't really apply to Sona.   Swifties would probably be best (but I have a bad habit of going Merc Treads despite them being nerfed kinda recently). Sorcerer's boots is still taken with WS KS at high ELO.",lolclass vid sona horribly date realise op 4months old ok sorry follow relevant mastery w q bring close together valuemana q still well hpmana let alone cd go ws keystone as should maxe w become whole lot well be maxe w 1st prepare mid game make protection adc less mana intensive even recent change maxe w legit uncommon option need play defensive early game mid game mana item like ardent censer morellonomiconathene unholy grail I hate item now since lose mana refil kill assist morello people still like it come guy would almost always max q 1st get really mad people think sona healer be nt now sona 2nd soraka one support often focus 1st sustain take word it ask rsonamain take ws ks intelligence max cdr heal l16 around 35 second that s constant armor mr buff group assume tagging aura take ardent censer also buff damage 30magic hit ok ca nt speak locket high elo legit popular consider spammy sona get now happen every day keep whole team alive wipe opposition without locket max cdr mana regen ap ws keystone unless either team wombo combo down locket crappy wombo combo happen locket awesome doubt win game play low elo someone insist take locket think ardent censer morello building ap block they bootseye golditemsightstone ardent censer morello hit cdr cap core everything else situational whether tank ap support item recognise neither team together enough make locket relevant but want practice use anyway that s excellent pretty much everything else line rsonamain think one thing query one even attempt justify sonas current stat sorcerer boot popular sona q r help q big deal use be assume take nashor think sorcerer boot ap conventional wisdom really apply sona swiftie would probably good but bad habit go merc tread despite nerfed kinda recently sorcerer boot still take ws ks high elo,309,-0.3684210526315789,0.061488673139158574,2016-09-07 08:54:23,-1,esg-bearish

8502,13491,"I agree that collective individual action is crucial, and I think this is a well written post. But I'm a technocrat on a wonk sub, so I want to nudge slightly at where we should put our focus.

Here's a surprising fact: even vegetarians, Buddhist monks, and the homeless in the US consume more than twice the global average of carbon.\[1\]

How is that even possible!?

""Potential"" efficiency costs energy. And people have access to enormous potential stuff in the US, from instant delivery of food, to same day delivery of electronics, to a bunch of government administrations working to provide you services (or at least repaired roads to drive on), to a Navy patrolling trade routes to make sure stuff from China can get to you cheap, fast, and safe.

We basically have so many institutional, systemic, and public factors (even on standby) that carbon consumption is inescapable in our current setup.

This isn't to say that (collective) individual action is meaningless, but ""do your part"" is already generally the primary focus of environmental campaigns. And it's not always with the best of intentions. ""Individual responsibility environmentalism"" didn't really come about by accident. Major industrial polluters definitely would prefer individual rather than corporate or regulatory action, and they've generally supported keeping the focus put there. For example, the Crying Native American ad and the ""Keep America Beautiful"" campaign is actually sponsored by a trade association that simultaneously opposes stricter recycling and waste legislation that would affect bottling companies.\[2\]

Part of the reason ""individual effort"" clicks is because humans are bad at scale. When we talk about the number of metric tons of carbon generated in the US, it breaks our heads. We get into numbers we can't even really comprehend.

Consider the following choice:

(a) You spend a few hours a week over the next few months crafting a smart update to CAFE standards. It would ultimately lower emissions **ONLY in transportation**, **ONLY by 0.01%**, and it in turn has **ONLY a 0.01% of passing**, or,

(b) You can completely eliminate your personal GHG consumption to its lowest possible floor.

If you want to maximize GHG reductions, well, sure, you should do both. But start with (a).\[2\]

The rejoinder is, ""well but what if everybody made these small changes?"" Sure, but that runs both ways. What if everybody wrote smarter policies and supported them?

Okay, sure. Imagining ""legislative drafting"" displacing sports as a national pastime sounds plainly ridiculous. But both that and ""imagine if everyone minimized their GHG emissions"" each fantasize away massive collective action problems.

But so... we can't get hundreds of millions of people to be policy wonks, fine. But you got this far because you actually like this stuff. You are perfectly positioned to take that one in a thousand shot at shaping policy. Did you read in depth about energy policy interest group tradeoffs over the last year, with an eye towards crafting an insightful letter to your representatives or a think tank?

Or ok, maybe you actually work in material science, and you have some idea you could pitch to a researcher working on photovoltaics, or batteries, or generators, or smart grids, or whatever. Or maybe you're in design or data science and you have a little free time on weekends to mock up something to help people understand emerging science on these issues. There might be something in your lane, whatever it is.

Don't just be an individual who makes a small difference. I mean, be that, but not just that. Also be an individual who takes a shot at changing everything. Even if you're almost guaranteed to fail, it's still worth it if enough of us just try.

8509,13545,"The fleet from Ra would consist of three main elements, the transports, the frigates and the ships of the line.

For this battle only the frigates and the ships of the line matter.

The frigate's main role will be recon, spreading out and watching the opponent from as far away as they can, communicating what they see to the mostly blind ships of the line in their giant clouds of chaff. These ships use a 10 meter diameter pusher plate and travel in squadrons of four (for this fleet three squadrons will suffice) and are capable of accelerating at up to 6g at full load (acceleration can theoretically hit 12g while running on empty, but the shock absorbers would not be able to keep up with anything above 8). They are lightly armed with only four nuclear pumped missiles, a light laser and some chaff and flair dispensers.

The ships of the line will deal with the majority of the fighting. They will probably employ the standard strategy of the era, accelerate towards the enemy, create a massive cloud of decoys, chaff and flairs prevent accurate long range fire, cruise towards the enemy and emerged guns blazing, firing everything they have as quickly as possible before retreating back though the cloud of chaff.

Ships of the line use the same 10m diameter pusher plate as the frigates, but are much heavier ships, sustain a 2g acceleration under full load at best (although this goes up to 4 as weapons and fuel depletes). They carry a large X ray laser (powered by the ships shock absorbers), tons of chaff, flairs and decoys, a recon drone and 24 missiles.

Each missiles is a nuclear pumped X ray laser. These missiles will attempt to get within a light second for two of the enemy before all pointing towards the target and detonating. The overlapping cones of X rays normally melt whatever they are pointing at.

Each squadron of ships of the line consists of four ships. Each of the three phases of the attack will consist of four squadrons. Thats 24\*4\*4\*3 missiles, or to put in actual numbers 1,152 missiles across all the ships of the line.

The ship's of the line are quite well protected, carrying two spare pusher plates in front of them to act as armor, a powerful laser to shoot down incoming projectiles, enough chaff to fill hundreds of cubic kilometers of space and the ability to fire their missiles defensively.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brief overview of the strategy:

The fleet will accelerate to their target. The ships of the line will make a could of dense chaff while the frigates spread out and get a bit ahead of them.

Once the main chaff cloud has gotten within 10 light seconds of the opponent (2.998e+6 km) the ships of the line will emerge form their clouds, fire one missile per second for 24 seconds, then retreat back into their chaff clouds and accelerate away form the enemy, spewing out even more chaff as they go and dropping one of their spare pusher plates to save on mass.

The next two attacks will each be space out by about an hour, hopefully giving the frigates enough time to determine the extent of damage the enemy sustained and prevent the next attack from firing at already dead ships.

If all three attacks don't succeeded the fleet as a whole will either retreat to the transports to re arm (the transports are probably somewhere around the astroid belt) or attack with the frigates (they only carry 48 missiles, so all 12 of them only have the fire power of two ships of the line).

8511,13562,"I'm kind of torn here. I've been really wanting to show off some of the new stuff I've been working on, but at the same time I really want the Human Union to get a chance to do this. Earth is their world, after all. So I think I'll use the Humans just once more, then the Pertican Commonwealth can start taking part once we return to regular battle royales.

Given the size of the fleet we're up against here, I think it's fairly reasonable for me to bring along another entire Battle Fleet. Specifically, Battle Fleet *Victory*, the fleet which ends up doing this exact thing in my universe's storyline (only not against Wraiths). I'm also downsizing it to more-or-less match your fleet. I'm making it pretty much [Battle Fleet *Zeus*](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8co4lj/scifi_boss_battle_royale_7_the_allegiance/dxgihot/) from the previous battle royale, only with HUAS *Zeus* swapped out for HUAS *Victory*. *Victory* is an experimental battleship fitted out with fancy prototype weapons. I'm not going to describe all the ships in detail, but here's a basic rundown of what the fleet as a whole brings to the field:

Weapons:

* 12x XLC15 heavy LASER cannons (on the *Victory*)

* 75x XLC14 medium LASER cannons (on the *Victory*)

* 150x XLC13 light LASER cannons (on the *Victory*)

* 300x XPD25 LASER point-defence systems (on the *Victory*)

* 30x LC5 heavy LASER cannons

* 495x LC4 medium LASER cannons

* 2110x LC3 light LASER cannons

* 4400x PD15 LASER point-defence systems

Beyond 0.1 light seconds, even *Victory* will struggle to do much damage. Effective range for the big guns on the other battleship and battlecruisers is about half of that, much closer for the remaining ships. So Battle Fleet *Victory* will probably sit at about 0.05 light seconds and bombard the Wraith fleet with its big guns, using its smaller weapons (and ships) to destroy anything stupid enough to try and approach and shooting down fighters with its frankly absurd amount of point-defence.

The fleet also carries with it 6300 infantry [Spatials](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8oiv0m/scifi_battle_royale_13_marines/e03x322/) and 220 [MEC-1S *Ogre* mechs](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8qbr5q/scifi_battle_royale_14_walkers/e0jmheh/), plus dropships and heavy dropships to carry them, APCs, IFVs, and reconnaissance vehicles, and gunships for close air support (I can give you the numbers if you really want me to). That's just over a brigade.

&nbsp;

Once orbital space is secured, the remaining ground forces will emerge from wormholes nearby. To make a full division (5 brigades in the Union), I'll bring a single half-full *Demon*-class assault transport carrying 3000 Shock Troopers and 1500 Shock Trooper-variant *Ogre* mechs (a brigade's worth in total), bringing my total force up to 2 brigades. Next will be three *Lizard*-class troop transports, each carrying a brigade of Army infantry and armour support. All also carry the necessary vehicle support. I'll go into more detail on the Shock Troopers next week, and the Army the week after.",I m kind tear here I ve really want show new stuff I ve work on time really want human union get chance this earth world all think ill use human more pertican commonwealth start take part return regular battle royale give size fleet be here think fairly reasonable bring along another entire battle fleet specifically battle fleet victory fleet end exact thing universe storyline only wraith I m also downsize moreorless match fleet I m make pretty much battle fleet zeushttpswwwredditcomrworldbuildingcomments8co4ljscifi_boss_battle_royale_7_the_allegiancedxgihot previous battle royale huas zeus swap huas victory victory experimental battleship fit fancy prototype weapon I m go describe ship detail here basic rundown fleet whole bring field weapon 12x xlc15 heavy laser cannon on victory 75x xlc14 medium laser cannon on victory 150x xlc13 light laser cannon on victory 300x xpd25 laser pointdefence system on victory 30x lc5 heavy laser cannon 495x lc4 medium laser cannon 2110x lc3 light laser cannon 4400x pd15 laser pointdefence system beyond 01 light second even victory struggle much damage effective range big gun battleship battlecruiser half that much close remain ship battle fleet victory probably sit 005 light second bombard wraith fleet big gun use small weapon and ship destroy anything stupid enough try approach shoot fighter frankly absurd amount pointdefence fleet also carry 6300 infantry spatialshttpswwwredditcomrworldbuildingcomments8oiv0mscifi_battle_royale_13_marinese03x322 220 mec1s ogre mechshttpswwwredditcomrworldbuildingcomments8qbr5qscifi_battle_royale_14_walkerse0jmheh plus dropship heavy dropship carry they apcs ifvs reconnaissance vehicle gunship close air support I give number really want to that s brigade nbsp orbital space secure remain ground force emerge wormhole nearby make full division 5 brigade union ill bring single halffull demonclass assault transport carry 3000 shock trooper 1500 shock troopervariant ogre mech a brigade worth total bring total force 2 brigade next three lizardclass troop transport carry brigade army infantry armour support also carry necessary vehicle support ill go detail shock trooper next week army week after,310,-0.7142857142857143,0.04516129032258064,2018-10-10 18:20:38,-1,esg-bearish

8517,13613,"In Looking Glass, you attack a planet by taking control of its orbit, using electronic warfare on ground systems, and landing small teams of marines at strategically vital points on the surface (for example, government or military installations). This strategy is what the militaries in my world are built for, which means I'm not too sure how useful I'll be in this fight which seems to be a little off Looking Glass's beaten path. There's a first time for everything, I guess.

I'll be sending a Kaghaka planetary superiority battlegroup to this fight. Volucrian navy spaceships (and all warships in my world, in fact) follow firm sci-fi rules, meaning they have very little armor, engage at extreme ranges, and have poor stealth ratings unless specifically designed for a stealth role. All spaceships are also torchships, meaning they can accelerate quickly at the cost of being very bright targets. All ships other than gunships are able to travel faster than light using an Alcubierre-style drive, but this requires a significant amount of power and the FTL drive segment is easily damaged because it is necessarily exposed. Firing railguns also requires a significant amount of power. The battlegroup includes the following warships:

**1 B-24-4 type Battleship:** the largest Volucrian ship-of-the-line and the tactical command and control ship for the battlegroup. The B-24-4 has heavy armor (for a firm sci-fi ship), lots of torpedos, and a devastating 210cm spinal railgun which fires projectiles at around .1c.

**3 CA-13-2 type Heavy Cruisers:** smaller, lighter versions of the B-24-4 with powerful weapons and capable point-defense. Their primary role, however, is electronic warfare: blinding sensors, jamming comms, and hacking into computers.

**4 CB-18-4 type Light Cruisers:** well rounded ships with decent armor, decent weapons, and extremely powerful point-defense capabilities. Altogether, their rapid-fire coilgun and laser batteries can put out hundreds of thousands of shots per minute.

**4 DA-36-1 type Torpedo Destroyers:** long-range strike warships which fire massive salvos of torpedos and then fade into the background of the battle. Poor armor and guns but decent point-defense and good maneuverability.

**6 DS-19-4 type Stealth Destroyers:** stealth destroyers built to engage enemy ships from the flank and provide fire support wherever necessary. Stealth warships are especially capable in planetary engagements because they can use emissions from the star or the planet to help mask their position.

**10 E-23-7 type Escort Gunships:** very small vessels used for point-defense coverage, scouting, and hit-and-run attacks. They carry 8 torpedoes, and can resupply by docking with a capital ship.

**12 E-26-2 type Stealth Gunships:** the smallest ships in the fleet. Built to remain undetected at close range and disable enemies with precision strikes. They are also used to transport boarding parties.

**2 SV-9-2 type Supply Transports:** large transport vessels with advanced warp capabilities.

**2 SV-9-3b type Personnel Transports:** large transport vessels with advanced warp capabilities built for orbital insertion of troops. The ship skims the atmosphere of the planet on a designated trajectory and launches drop pods from the ""bottom"" (planet side) of the ship. Each pod carries a team of 30 marines in full power armor and free-falls towards the surface until the last possible moment, at which point it decelerates. Pods also have a basic point-defense system in the form of a gatling gun mounted on the top.

8521,13647,"Well - the UNHA also has a long tradition of fighting over Earth, and they've mostly *won*. The fact that their foes this time around are hellish aliens unlike anything they've ever encountered before isn't going to dissuade them from trying again!

I fortunately also have an [external document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-dVe7X7vjU3onlE_8vAKoDeaFqkxDE76wvSSpX6Cag), in this case for summing up the actual orbital-combatant orbital force the UNHA will be sending to pick this fight. Because of the smaller than normal force they will be opposing, I am cutting off out some groups from the total fleet arrangement.

#Brief ships descriptions:

**Dreadnoughts: Valhalla (2) and Astatiir (1)**

By far the largest and most fearsome warships in the UNHA arsenal, each 2-3 kilometers long. In addition to several batteries of gigaton-range weapons similar to the main battery of a *Roosevelt*-class battleship, each also carries Grav-wave projectors - a form of gravitational electronic warfare intended to immobilize jump drives in my setting. It may not actually work on anything here. The Astatiir is an older design and lacks as many point-defenses.

**Battleships: [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sNpFRCPTydEcbXBLgI1EFKElezbNNwBpnvgsOm5afwg) (12)**

With a main battery of eighteen hydrogen accelerators and twelve antimatter cannon both in the gigatons-per-shot range, these aging battleships still pack a wallop. Unfortunately, is suspect they're going to be among the slowest things here. 

**Cruisers:**

[Darwin V-class](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r5XDF0J5Y2lv_QKHEG_jDsqJnaL66Zmi6tTzV_i1yz0) (35) ( [Bottom here](https://imgur.com/ji5uXwq) ) the workhorse cruiser of the UNHA fleet, it carries a decent offensive armament of numerous guns in the double-digit megaton range and capable mech complement. Well-suited for escort, assaulting lighter targets, or heavy reconnaissance.

Darwin IV-D-class (4) - somehow managing to fit even more mechs into the Darwin hull for a grand total of 66, these hulls are optimized for point-defense and escort. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost - the removal of some ventral heavy particle cannon turrets.

[Horizon-class](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8n36v7/scifi_battle_royale_12_destroyers/dzt5vlf) (11) - although carrying less than half the mech complement than a Darwin, the Horizon brings a battery of four powerful antimatter cannon to the table. They are relatively short-ranged, however, forcing the Horizon to get to close range before bringing its full firepower to bear.

[Terhenetar-class Strike Cruiser](https://imgur.com/2Op67Is) - [Stats here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JHSvL-9QagfWWhnCv1UOSKwrqZ9903lCRVR_Y3ZRes) - Intended to jump rapidly in and out of lightly-defended enemy forces, delivering a punishing blow with its heavy particle cannon and massive missile batteries before escaping again into FTL.

**Gunships:**

[Cossack-class Escort Gunship](https://imgur.com/ji5uXwq) - [stats here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kJbPvtGoOg5RBfd0hIKGN6Cs12URNTy5Z52xjtHvgY0/edit#heading=h.87vku5h4sumh) - little more than a ""self-propelled point defense battery"", these small warships feature numerous point defense guns and a decent missile arrangement. They will not stray far from the vessels they are meant to protect.

**Troop carriers:**

Scezla-class Invasion Support Ship (2) - Somewhat analogous to an LHD or LPD in modern terms, Scezla-class hulls carry little offensive armament and no small craft for self-defense. What they *do* carry, however, is armament tuned to ground-support and a large number of drop-pod tubes, including mech-sized ones, and dropships of multiple sizes - including the UNHA's three primary types, the OLAC-13 'Hiryu', OLAC-18 'Kalor', and OLAC-19 'Muromets'. These are at least a kilometer in length.

Nephlet-class Invasion Support Ship (5) - Similar to the above but considerably smaller, these vessels are more suitable for tactical support and precision drops than the lumbering bulk of a Scezla. However, they lack the same dropship volume and cannot support the OLAC-19 Dropships.

Gleipnir-class Transport (4) - The first of the UNHA transports capable of actually descending into the atmosphere, the Gleipnir is a bulk carrier. It lacks anything beyond point defenses and heavy armor, but can each can carry most of a Brigade inside its massive hold. Slow and defenseless, it will make its descent into a safe landing zone.

Ka-Matet-class Landing Transport (2) - Unlike the above, the Ka-Matet is moderately armed and extremely well armored. It can take a few hits on the way down to a planet's surface; however, you aren't going to be fitting much more than a battalion into its hold.

**Other assorted miscellaneous stuff:**

FTL barges, repair hulks, logistics and resupply vessels will form up under their own group.

#A brief note on troop organization:

Right now, you're looking at a heavily over-strength division. Of that, two brigades are aboard two of the Gleipnirs - including all support forces - and the remaining brigades are split among the Ka-Matets and Invasion Support Ships.

#Tactics/Opening Moves:

UNHA warships need to get quite close (in space terms) to engage, so for the moment they are going to form a screening line, throw up a load of jamming, and wait to see what is going on. Those ships coupled to FTL barges will not uncouple if they can avoid it, while the support vessels and troopships will remain far, far away with the intent of jumping in only when this round is complete and orbital control has largely been assured; a single group of three cruisers escorts them.

With that in mind, a brief note: Two Battleships are organically attached to each Dreadnought in the flotilla, but they can be detached to operate independently. Cruisers usually work in mutually self-supporting groups of three, which can either be operating independently or supporting a larger vessel. The Escort Gunships  are literally everywhere, and - by the document I linked above - there are several hundred single-person small craft awaiting launch when it comes time to commit.",well unha also long tradition fight earth they ve mostly win fact foe time around hellish alien unlike anything they ve ever encounter go dissuade try again fortunately also external documenthttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1pdve7x7vju3onle_8vakodeafqkxde76wvsspx6cag case sum actual orbitalcombatant orbital force unha send pick fight small normal force oppose cut group total fleet arrangement brief ship description dreadnought valhalla 2 astatiir 1 far large fearsome warship unha arsenal 23 kilometer long addition several battery gigatonrange weapon similar main battery rooseveltclass battleship also carry gravwave projector form gravitational electronic warfare intend immobilize jump drive set may actually work anything here astatiir old design lack many pointdefense battleship franklin delano roosevelthttpsdrivegooglecomopenid1snpfrcptydecbxblgi1efkelezbnnwbpnvgsom5afwg 12 main battery eighteen hydrogen accelerator twelve antimatter cannon gigatonspershot range age battleship still pack wallop unfortunately suspect they re go among slow thing here cruiser darwin vclasshttpsdrivegooglecomopenid1r5xdf0j5y2lv_qkheg_jdsqjnal66zmi6ttzv_i1yz0 35 bottom herehttpsimgurcomji5uxwq workhorse cruiser unha fleet carry decent offensive armament numerous gun doubledigit megaton range capable mech complement wellsuited escort assault light target heavy reconnaissance darwin ivdclass 4 somehow manage fit even mechs darwin hull grand total 66 hull optimize pointdefense escort unfortunately come cost removal ventral heavy particle cannon turret horizonclasshttpswwwredditcomrworldbuildingcomments8n36v7scifi_battle_royale_12_destroyersdzt5vlf 11 although carry less half mech complement darwin horizon bring battery four powerful antimatter cannon table relatively shortrange however force horizon get close range bring full firepower bear terhenetarclass strike cruiserhttpsimgurcom2op67is stat herehttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd19jhsvl9qagfwwhncv1uoskwrqz9903lcrvr_y3zre intended jump rapidly lightlydefende enemy force deliver punish blow heavy particle cannon massive missile battery escape ftl gunship cossackclass escort gunshiphttpsimgurcomji5uxwq stat herehttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1kjbpvtgoog5rbfd0hikgn6cs12urnty5z52xjthvgy0editheadingh87vku5h4sumh little selfpropelled point defense battery small warship feature numerous point defense gun decent missile arrangement stray far vessel mean protect troop carrier scezlaclass invasion support ship 2 somewhat analogous lhd lpd modern term scezlaclass hull carry little offensive armament small craft selfdefense do carry however armament tune groundsupport large number droppod tube include mechsize one dropship multiple size include unha three primary type olac13 hiryu olac18 kalor olac19 muromet least kilometer length nephletclass invasion support ship 5 similar considerably small vessel suitable tactical support precision drop lumber bulk scezla however lack dropship volume can not support olac19 dropship gleipnirclass transport 4 first unha transport capable actually descend atmosphere gleipnir bulk carrier lack anything beyond point defense heavy armor carry brigade inside massive hold slow defenseless make descent safe landing zone kamatetclass landing transport 2 unlike above kamatet moderately armed extremely well armored take hit way planet surface however go fit much battalion hold other assorted miscellaneous stuff ftl barge repair hulk logistic resupply vessel form group a brief note troop organization right now look heavily overstrength division that two brigade aboard two gleipnir include support force remain brigade split among kamatet invasion support ship tacticsopene move unha warship need get quite close in space term engage moment go form screen line throw load jamming wait see go on ship couple ftl barge uncouple avoid it support vessel troopship remain far far away intent jump round complete orbital control largely assure single group three cruiser escort they mind brief note two battleship organically attach dreadnought flotilla detach operate independently cruiser usually work mutually selfsupporte group three either operate independently support large vessel escort gunship literally everywhere document link several hundred singleperson small craft await launch come time commit,529,-0.44680851063829785,0.0888468809073724,2018-10-11 05:14:19,-1,esg-bearish
8523,13664,"Alright, so my space opera-esque world is very much in preliminary development, but due to my love of sci fi military design and giant invasions, I simply couldn't resist. This'll probably set me way behind schedule on developing the other worlds I've started, but here goes nothing!

*Though in my universe Earth has long since been transformed into an impenetrable metropolis planet and has since been renamed ""Gaea"", let's just say by some freak temporal disturbance the UGC decided to drift off somewhere else. The UGC hears of the intrusion on Earth, and sends the 31st Planetary Assault Detachment of 1st Grand Fleet to secure Columbia, in the name of the homeworld!*

**The 31st Planetary Assault Detachment**

*The pride of the 1st Fleet, the 31st Detachment is legendary for their exploits in planetary assaults across the galaxy, and though hundreds of its ships have been lost since its founding, its mythic reputation remains.*


**The 31st currently consists of:**

1x Command Wing

5x Bombardment Wings

1x Support Wing

4x Orbital Engagement Wings

2x Planetfall Wings

2x Infiltration Wing


*Each wing will be summarized below. Keep in mind that though the overall vessels are the same for a Wing type, their payload may differ slightly from the norm.*


**Command Wing**

The command wing of the 31st is obviously the most defended, as loss of the *Majestic* would cripple the Detachment.


*1 Indomitable-class Command Mega-Carrier ‚ÄúMajestic‚Äù*: The *Majestic* is the flagship of the 31st, inheriting the title after its predecessor, the *Gloriam Aut Mortem* was destroyed during the 7th Typhon Campaign when it was crippled and rammed itself into the Typhon Initiative fleet world Medusa IV destroying both itself and the enemy presence upon the planet. The *Majestic* was built to replace it, and boasts an impressive array of weaponry, as well as an increased size. The reason the flagship *Majestic* is a mega-carrier instead of the typical dreadnought is due to the 31st detachment‚Äôs purpose, as the Majestic is to release its payload of ships and fighters for planetfall once the orbital defenses have been cleared away. Other than its deadly cargo, the carrier is equipped with a Capital-class shield generator, which will take extreme effort to overheat. From its 57 campaigns, the shield has only failed twice. For anti Space-fighter purposes, the *Majestic* boasts 150 point-defense rail turrets, which are deadly accurate but lack speed; 80 Icarus repeating pulse arrays, rapid fire energy cannons that can overwhelm fighters with a wave of pulse blasts; 45 Heavy Blast Cannons, these are slow, semi auto cannons that evaporate small spacecraft upon contact. For ship to ship combat the *Majestic* has 20 Broadside Cannons, energy based projectile launchers that carve craters through shielding and hulls. For a ship of its size, these armaments are quite minimal, as the hangar of the *Majestic* contains enough dropships to decimate the terrestrial defenses after most of the anti-ship emplacements have been cleared away by other Wings.


*1 Warden-class Dreadnought ‚ÄúShield of Gaea‚Äù*: The *Shield of Gaea* is the most deadly craft in the detachment, bristling with weaponry, but perhaps its most distinguishable feature is its artificial gravity generator. For any dreadnought the generator must undoubtedly powerful, but Warden-classes boast gravitational generators even more powerful. Warden Dreadnoughts are also equipped with not one but three Capital-class shield generators. These two pieces of equipment are the reasons for the Warden-class‚Äô effectiveness. Built as flagship bodyguards, once both the shields and grav-generator are activated, all fire directed at other ships within a 50km radius will be pulled towards the Warden-class and fizzle on its powerful shields. On addition, any ship smaller than a corvette will begin to be pulled towards the massive gravitational well, and be torn apart by the dreadnought‚Äôs formidable weapons. The *Shield of Gaea* has 100 Antimatter beamers, massive turrets that shred through everything; 10 SRAs (Superheavy Rail Accelerators), which are essentially my universe‚Äôs equivalent of a nuke. These are among its most powerful armaments, the ship still has a motherlode of smaller weapons. In the Command Wing, the Warden-class flies in front of the flagship.

*2 Excalibur-class Destroyers*: The sleek Excalibur-class destroyers are the pinnacle of ship-to-ship combat, bristling with broadside cannons and each equipped with a devastating Particle Obliterator Beam installed in their sterns. These beams are meant for long range destruction, and strip away shields and armor like wet paper. Extremely maneuvrable, these ships flank the flagship, ready to destroy assailants.


*4 Heavy Cruisers*: Your run of the mill cruisers, with standard-grade shield generators and a fair amount of firepower.


*10 Chaser-class Corvettes*: The smallest class of military non-fighter spacecraft, with light, all-purpose weaponry. This specific Chaser-class is exponentially faster, but rather limited in its armaments.

Other Wings coming up!

8524,13678,"What a bunch of bullshit.

>(iii) systemic changes are necessary to solve climate change. I argue that only the third argument is a valid conclusion

I agree, but systemic changes mean getting rid of captialism and replacing it with something called post-growth-economics.

Please explain to me, how we shrink our global consumption back to 1970's level with capitalism? It won't work since capitalism relies on growth. 

This has nothing to do with who owns the means of production.

Your TLDR states:

8525,13681,"From the Federation Navy and the Federation Marines will be deployed Battlegroup Delta of III Fleet, Cepheid Dragons, escorting the 15th Orbital Transport Task Force, in turn carrying the 305th Mechanized Division, the 153rd Assault Division, the 1252nd Air Superiority Wing, the 1589th Ground Support Wing, and the 1901st Tactical Airlift Wing, totaling 20,000 troops and over a hundred aircraft of varying types.

Battlegroup Delta III is flagged by the Colossus-class dreadnought FIFS *Winter Soldier*, DN823. Squadron D30 includes *Winter Soldier* and is the Battlegroup Command Squadron, with 2 Wasp-class light strike carriers, 4 New Cairo-class destroyers, and 10 Liberator-class frigates. Squadron D31, the Battlegroup Reconaissance Task Force, is flagged by a [Kingfisher-class](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/99e4ls/comment/e4q6r3y?st=JN3G9QU3&sh=8a9d700f) strike cruiser with a Wasp-class light strike carrier and a trio of New Cairo-class destroyers in tow. The remaining combat squadrons, the Battlegroup Strike Squadrons D32 and D33, are each flagged by a Battleaxe-class cruiser in command of 4 New Cairo-class destroyers and 10 Liberator-class frigates. Squadron D34 is a logistics unit consisting of 4 Islander-class replenishment ships.

The 15th Orbital Transport Task Force will consist of 8 Marchand-class orbital assault vessels, each one capable of carrying 5,000 troops or a few dozen aircraft. Only 6 will be carrying combat units; the remainder will be transporting supplies and extra landers. Each OAV will be carrying a number of CR55 Reaver assault landers, CR57 Raider heavy transport landers, and C93 Cavalier cargo shuttles, the first carrying infantry, the second carrying armor and vehicles, and the third carrying general-purpose cargo. The numbers here are highly variable since the number of landers and shuttles required depends on the force composition, but totals are usually in the hundreds. 

The Federation Marines 305th Mechanized Division consists of 5 Infantry Mechanized brigades, 2 Infantry Motorized brigades, 1 Reconnaissance Motorized brigade, 2 Line Armored sections, and 1 Support Mechanized section. Each Infantry Mechanized brigade consists of 10 ‚Äú[heavy](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9f8cd8/comment/e5vqo5e?st=JN3G454J&sh=2da254a1)‚Äù infantry platoons, one fire support unit consisting of 8 [FSV32 Wolfpacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/94cirg/comment/e3oqrnm?st=JN3JBE45&sh=12946030), and one air defense squadron consisting of 4 APC44/2B Skyshield MSAM/CRAMs. Both Infantry Motorized brigades consist of 10 ‚Äú[light](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9f8cd8/comment/e5vqo5e?st=JN3G454J&sh=2da254a1)‚Äù infantry platoons, one fire support squadron consisting of 8 [FSV32 Wolfpacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/94cirg/comment/e3oqrnm?st=JN3JBE45&sh=12946030), and one air defense squadron consisting of 4 APC44/2B Skyshields.

The Federation Marines 153rd Assault Division, one of the Marines‚Äô infamous ‚Äòshock assault‚Äô units, consists of 9 Infantry Airborne brigades, 1 Reconnaissance Airborne brigade, and 1 Assault Vertol section. Each Infantry Airborne brigade consists of 10 [airborne](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9f8cd8/comment/e5vqo5e?st=JN3G454J&sh=2da254a1) infantry platoons and one fire support unit consisting of 2 CV59/4D Hussar gunships, each armed with twin pulseguns, 32 Air Lance ATGMs, and thermobaric rocket pods. The Reconnaissance Airborne brigade is essentially the same as the Reconnaissance Motorized brigade, except the Marine Rangers ride in CV59Es. The Assault Vertol section consists of 3 squads of 2 AV64 Reaper gunships, armed with an 80mm repeating railcannon in a turret mount and a variety of hardpoints ordnance, plus a squad of 3 [AV64/6C Trailbreaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9f8cd8/comment/e5vqo5e?st=JN3G454J&sh=2da254a1) gunships, specially equipped for the EW and SEAD role. 


The 1252nd Air Superiority Wing- not that the Marines actually have 1,000 air wings, all air wings start with a number over 1,000- consists of 16 air superiority squadrons, each consisting of a single F78A Super Phantom air superiority fighter and 4 [Q59 Viper](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9l0y60/comment/e73qzkq?st=JN3SYLPN&sh=bba24ec6) drones, plus 4 SMC93 Nimbus aerial refueling and rearming aircraft.

The 1901st Tactical Airlift Wing contains 30 C93 Cavalier cargo shuttles, 20 CV59E Specter transport vertols, and 40 CV60C Atlas heavy cargo vertols, designed to pick up and haul around almost any Federation land vehicle, up to and including a Connelin assault tank. Demar√©e heavy tanks and Meteor Shower MLRSs are among the few vehicles beyond the Atlas‚Äôs impressive vertical lifting capability. 

(There‚Äôs a lot of stuff here not linked in any previous SFBRs or canon iterations, but I‚Äôll elaborate upon anything if you ask about it)

___

An engagement like this is going to start with the Federation fleet entering the system just outside the Kuiper belt. Making best speed, the fleet would enter the geopause roughly 72 hours later. At that point, they are most likely going to come in ‚Äúhot‚Äù and do a braking maneuver at periapsis while slingshotting around the moon. The Recon Squadron will not participate in the braking maneuver and will move into a lower orbit to get a good look at the Wraith fleet. They won‚Äôt get into engagement range if they can help it but they will drop several flights of Broadsword stealth bombers, who are then going to try and get on the other side of the Wraiths from the fleet‚Äôs path of engagement, mimicking various innocuous satellites when not hiding behind debris. By this point the Recon Squadron is going be making its way back to rendezvous with the main fleet for the assault. The Battlegroup will, meanwhile, be preparing its first salvo on the Wraith fleet from the spinal cannons, putting downrange a huge storm of flak shells. Once the range falls more, the fleet will carry out another single unified bombardment with slug rounds before engaging with their turreted weapons and missiles. Targets for the spinal rail bombardments will be prioritized as the interdictors; their comms jammers could be a huge problem for the Federation fleet.

 As for the engagement itself, the Federation fleet is going to try to remain at a distance. The cruisers will get a ways out in front of the fleet so their secondary deflector screens can interdict and disrupt ballistic projectiles heading for ships further behind them, while meanwhile engaging with their missile racks and turreted railcannons. The frigates, in turn, will screen the cruisers with their large array of flak weaponry, lethal at close range but more importantly, highly effective in the point defense role. Defense screening will be coordinated over the high-bandwidth battlenet used by the Navy, all the point defense weapons in the fleet acting with a single mind. *Winter Soldier* itself will be laying down a withering barrage of 350mm railgun fire, while the destroyers around it unload their massive missile racks- SSAS/H-24 Star Lance missiles with nuclear-pumped laser warheads for punching holes in things, SSAM/H-35 Flashbang missiles with multi-gigaton fusion warheads for blinding enemy sensors and destroying swarms of fighters or missile, and SSIM/H-27 Iron Dome missiles to intercept incoming projectiles and strike craft. The fleet will aim to keep distance between it and the Wraiths, but if that proves impossible the large batteries of 175mm autocannons carried aboard all Federation vessels will come into play, at which point things will get extremely messy.

The strike craft will come into play at this point- ideally, Recon Squadron‚Äôs strike craft will be behind the Wraiths, while the main fleet‚Äôs will be slowly closing the distance forwards in the chaos of the firefight. Both will launch their payloads, SSAS/L-7 Harpoon missiles with NPL warheads, simultaneously, aiming to cause maximum confusion with a surprise attack from multiple angles. The rear group, especially, will be aiming for any vulnerable rear areas they can pick out on the Wraith ships. 

The Orbital Transport ships will, of course, be staying far away while all this is occurring.

I understand why as an investor in private equity you might want to put money in socially responsible ventures because it actually makes an impact. Your capital goes to the company to develop their CO2 scrubbers and women school of engineering (just random examples). But why is it a big concern for secondary markets like the shares these ETFs own? Your capital doesn't go to the company, it goes to the previous guy that owned the shares.
