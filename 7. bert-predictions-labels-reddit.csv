‚ÄúInterested to see the energy output compared to a standard turbine, they conveniently left it out which makes me very skeptical.

Edit: Someone wrote this in response

‚ÄúA standard full-sized wind turbine produces roughly 1.5-2 Megawatts (1,500,000-2,000,000 W) at optimal wind speeds and optimal wind directions (which depends on the model), and then diminish at subobtimal conditions.

The bladeless turbine however is estimated to output only 100W, or around a staggering 0.0066 - 0.005% the output of a traditional turbine.

You guys are falling for PR.

These companies aren't moving away from fossil fuels because of any sort of activism, they're moving away from fossil fuels because renewables are set to become cheaper than them.

This article is from 2 years ago:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/01/13/renewable-energy-cost-effective-fossil-fuels-2020/#54c78f5e4ff2

*The cost of renewable energy is now falling so fast that it should be a consistently cheaper source of electricity generation than traditional fossil fuels within just a few years, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).*

So these funds are just ditching soon-to-be unprofitable companies and moving to profitable companies.

In 2007 MT ramped from $25 (in April) to $100 (in December) and then to $245 in June of 2008. You say you think fair value is $45. How do you think this supercycle compares to that one? Faster / shorter / smaller? You need to wait and see?

I have several positions but recently got some new capital and am looking at various LEAP expirations... and I'd love to hear your view comparing the two before I make my final decisions on which expirations to purchase.

Thanks!",vito amazing thank you one question you 2007 mt ramp 25 in april 100 in december 245 june 2008 say think fair value 45 think supercycle compare one fast shorter small need wait see several position recently get new capital look various leap expiration i d love hear view compare two make final decision expiration purchase thank,57,-1.0,0.03508771929824561,2021-03-16 06:05:47,-1,esg-bearish,esg-bullish

I think it's worth it, but I recognize that it only makes sense if you have some optimism that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.  I know enough smart people who are convinced ethical funds make no difference that I'm not confident that there's actually some good accomplished through the money itself, but, I think it's unlikely to be making things worse. Plus, as these funds gain market share and visibility they grow awareness and dialog around what our values are and how that connects to money. 

Also, I think that there's an argument that ethical investments are less risky-- if a business is more exploitative or it goes against common values, I think it's more likely that customers, competitors, and/or regulators find a way to make it so the business can't keep profiting by doing what it's doing.

My grandfather was a radio sports director for WKRC in Cincinnati and one of the first people outside of the inner circle to find out Paul Brown was bringing a football team to Cincy. He was a lifelong fan through and through but sadly he passed away back in 2004 and sometimes it hits me how I never really got to enjoy the Bengals with him during this resurgence but I want to live vicariously through you because your dad in the video reminded me so much of my late father that my eyes were cloudy watching the whole thing. I'll be there for the Jets game and seriously would love to tailgate with you just so I can shake your guy's hands and give a big old WHO DEY to you.
