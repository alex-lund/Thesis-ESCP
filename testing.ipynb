My qualifications on this subject are:\\n\\n* I'm a random jack-ass on Reddit\\n* I live in oil-country Kansas\\n\\nHere is what I found when googling the issue. From a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/climate/trump-methane-climate-change.html) on the subject:\\n\\n> The E.P.A.’s new methane rule eliminates federal requirements that oil  and gas companies must install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from wells, pipelines and storage sites.   \\n>  \\n>E.P.A. officials say the new, weaker methane rule is needed to free the oil and gas industry from what they call crippling regulations at a moment when companies are suffering from plummeting prices and falling demand driven by a sharp global economic slowdown. The weakening of the rule, however, **has been in the works for more than a year.** \\n\\nLarge oil companies don't want the EPA to roll this back. They've spent a lot of money trumpeting how great they are for switching to natural gas. They also have the advantage of huge R&D departments and production at scale. These devices won't be as much of a burden on them as on smaller companies. I would be for the government producing these devices and passing them out for the same cost per well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Several of the biggest oil and gas companies have called on the Trump  administration to tighten restrictions on methane, not loosen them. **Larger energy companies have invested millions of dollars to promote natural gas** as a cleaner option than coal in the nation’s power plants, because natural gas produces about half as much carbon dioxide when burned. **They fear that unrestricted leaks of methane could undermine that marketing message and hurt demand.**   \\n>  \\n>Gretchen Watkins, the United States chairwoman for Shell, which has  urged the Trump administration to regulate methane emissions, said, “**The negative impacts of methane have been widely acknowledged for years**, so it’s frustrating and disappointing to see the administration go in a different direction.”\",\n",

Good soil fertility = better agriculture outcomes= better carbon sink.\\n\\n\\n2) PROBLEMS IF AGRICULTURE WAS THE ONLY FOOD SOURCE USED (with its current mainstream practices):\\n\\nA) MONOCROPPING\\n\\nDefinition: the planting of only one type of crop\\n\\nReasons against: \\n-reduces soil fertility \\n- leads to run off that pollutes our waters\\n- leads to erosion \\n- requires pesticide use\\n\\nSolution: \\n- polycropping\\n- inter/alley cropping\\n- crop rotation \\n\\n\\nB) PESTICIDE USE\\n\\nReasons against:\\n- only approx. 2% of pesticides make it on to the desired target\\n- the other 98% becomes airborne pollutants or run off\\n- pests develop resistance easily due to short life spans and then require larger doses or a whole new type of pesticide further polluting soils\\n- unintended side effect: kills potential pest predators too\\n\\nSolution: use of plants that fend of pests\\n\\nC) WATER MANAGEMENT \\nNote: With only having 2.5% of the worlds water be fresh water and only 0.5 % be accessible (aka not tied up in glaciers/ permafrost)we need to treat ol’ blue right.\\n\\nProblem: \\n- ground water/aquifer depletion \\n- pollution from fertilizer and pesticide run off leading to eutrophication \\n- desalination is not as environmentally friendly as was hoped (energy wise and the addition of salt back into the ocean—> changes salinity—> changes animals habitats)\\n\\nSolution:\\n- retention ponds\\n- terracing\\n- trees\\n\\nD) TILLING (turning over the soil)\\nNote: when I learned this it was a big surprise to me...\\n\\nProblem:\\n- leads to leeching ( putting the nutrients into soil horizons inaccessible to plants)\\n- soil crusting that leads nutrient run off\\n\\nSolution:\\n-  No till farming ( e.g shallow cultivation)\\n- use of “green litter” \\n\\n\\n\\nTAKE AWAY:  REDUCING CONSUMPTION= GOOD.

Rotational crop production in large scale agriculture is a joke to the health of the soils demise.  Annual crops can never build soils.. perennials that stay in place do but not when you rip up the ground every year and replant!! \\n\\nThat's why non of us meat eaters listen to your Vegan propaganda.

Top soil depletion is a huge problem still.. river pollution from farms still raises the salinity of the rivers downstream over 30 fold.  Never mind the fact that these things could be mitigated by small changes in production like allowing for furloughed strips on the edges of fields or near runoff.. pretty sure that change alone would stop 70% of topsoil loss or something crazy like that but you're too focused on us meat eaters to worry about growing your food properly.\",\n",

       "              \"Absolutelly! There are several reasons why this is true. It is a really complex issue, but, as we must understand sustainability, there is no scenario in which we humans bet for a sustained economic growth while making life bearable for the most vulnerable majorities living in our planet.\\n\\nThere is no argue about this fact. And here I'll expose some of the reasons that sustain that statement. I'll try to be thorough:\\n\\nIn these days that we are living and those that will come, we'll have to make the less harmful decisions. As result of the decision that were made in the past and which can't be reversed, we are living in a system that is collapsing. And I highlight that they are not reversible as Climate Change is something that will happen even though we cut drastically our global GHE, and the same can be told about the ecosystemic destruction, the decrease of energy availability and a large etc of factors that define our times. Thinking otherwise is giving to the human being capacities which we don't possess.\\n\\nAnd what are the less harmful decisions? It depends on how we face that question. Non-optimal options that lie ahead are multiple and in different fields, but i'll focus on one related to this post. The ones that are being contemplated are retaking the path of growth or starting policies based on degrowth of energy and material consumption. Which one is the less harmful? There is no doubt about any of those is sub-optimal.\\n\\nIn the scenario in which countries do their climate homework and choose drastic policies sustained in time of degrowth, enhancing local economy and the primary sector while keeping the actual structure of the laboral market, there would be a massive job destruction. Living in a society in which satisfying our necessitoes relies on money, which we can only obtain with jobs, this is obviously not an optimal solution. There are some measures that could soften the impact of this option, like reducing the workday and others related to wealth redistribution ([a pilar of sustainability as the founders of the concept itself stated in the early 70's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth)) - basic income, expropriation, actually distributed taxation -. But we should go even further giving people autonomy and changing the life conditions to make the basic necessities not dependent of the market.\\n\\nIn my opinion, in our highly unequal societies in which we live in we should struggle to put them in march. Most likely, it won't happen nor fast enough neither with the adequate extension. Opposing to them there are very powerful forces. Even though it is true that living more austere lifes and with an harmonic relationship with ecosystems lead to more plenty and happier lifes.\\n\\nSo, let's see what to expect from the other option: retaking the economic growth. This can be achieved throughout two major policy blocks: \\xa0on the one hand, those based in a massive use of fossil fuels and the maximum exploitation of natural resources, the option _business as usual_ (BAU); and on the other hand, those involved in the denominated _Green New Deal_ (GND), which pivots on a massive deployment of renewable energies.\\n\\nThe BAU option is exemplified by the removal of the Environmental Law from Donald Trump, or the Chinese bet for Carbon. All accompanied by a huge amount of money creation which usually ends up in the most contaminating part of the economy. This will lead us to a planet 4-6 Celsius degrees over the actual climate stability, which would mean that major parts of our planet would be impracticable for human life.\\n\\nRunaway Climate Change is our worst choice, it has already produced over 500k deaths, and it will get worse. Without going any further, it is producing the right conditions to pandemic proliferation. Its impacts increase exponentially as the temperature raises, and I think something that we have learned about the covid crisis that we are living is to understand the importance of the exponentially rising curves. We are already living in a time of resource depletion and an early complete disruption of certain ecosystems.\\n\\nGND is not an option either, mainly due to two reasons. In the short term, it would increase the GHE, and in the mid term, the reduction won't be enough. The second reason is that there are not enough materials to carry it out. In addition, there are more arguments about their inability to maintain the current lifestyle and growth, such as the limited power and versatility of renewables. GND is a false optimal solution.\\n\\nTo all this we should add that, even with strong redistributive measures, both options, BAU and GND, involve high suffering of millions of people, because they are based on maintaining the social and territorial gap. It is one of the keys to the functioning of capitalism.\\n\\nThus, in all options, the popular classes are quite likely to suffer. Although in all of them this suffering will depend on the struggles we wage to achieve a greater or lesser redistribution of wealth, the suffering will be inherently unequal in all three ways. While in the option of degrowth what is on the table is the degree of economic hardship that many people endure, betting on growth what we risk, without exaggerating an iota, is life.\\n\\nWhat do I think that our real options are?\\n\\nTo build a postcapitalist economy based on a de-commercialization and de-desalination of our lives. No minimally emancipatory change can be realized without confrontation with the capitalist classes.\\n\\nSome of you will argue that this is something that it is not socially possible. However, this idea is losing strength after the Covid-19 pandemic. These days life has been prioritized, and we have realized what are the essential services to mantain a dignified life: food, health, waste management, care for dependent persons, etc. These essential services fit in with the triad of decreases-localization-primary economy. And all this has come about with a high level of social consensus. What seemed impossible, suddenly, in a few weeks, has become an assumed reality. \\n\\nHowever, economic and political powers are already striving to implement the same policies that led to this disaster based on environmental destruction and the extension of economic globalization. It’s like seeing someone who, just as he begins to recover a little bit from a heart attack, begins to plan on returning with redoubled strength to the way of life that led him to that situation.\\n\\nAnyhow, We would be deceived if we thought that what we are living is a parenthesis, a punctual pause -more or less long and deep- in the normality. Nothing will be ever the same than before. The collapse of our system will produce other shocking situations. To cite one example among many, we are likely to experience increasingly long periods of supply of fossil fuels, which will lead to a cascade of socio-economic impacts, starting with the short-circuit of human transport and, Which is more relevant, goods. Something that may still seem distant is becoming more and more likely. Crude oil prices on the ground are leading to the bankruptcy of US fracking companies, but in general they are a problem of the sector, which sees its profitability diminishing. This results in the reduction in investments, which is already underway. The result is that the lower availability of crude oil is reinforced. In such a situation, a massive restriction of mobility can be understood as logical by the population and this restriction is not only personal, but also implies a commitment to more local production and consumption. Much more local than that. Again, something that is difficult to put forward today at the political level, but much less than before the pandemic, can be made feasible.\\n\\nIn the face of that fear, our responsibility is to convey hope, for only another emotion can help to overcome it. I say it’s a responsibility because I think we have to do it, even if it weakens us. If we who fight for a just, democratic and sustainable world do not do so, no one will realize it, and without hope there is no emancipatory process of change that can succeed. Other social sectors will use this fear to maintain their positions of power by fomenting confrontations among the popular classes.\\n\\nI don’t mean a hope in magic solutions, or in the return to the previous normal. That’s impossible. I am referring to the hope that the collapse of this social and economic order may offer us opportunities to build societies where life is worth living. A hope centered on a lucid thought.\\n\\nThe emotional burden of making the least bad decisions is very heavy. In normal times, we can afford a way to be flaccid. Let us be carried away by collective and individual automatisms. In times like these we are living in, we have a vital and ethical obligation to grow in the challenges we face in our personal lives and in our political choices.\",\n",

Not on an international scale. Not even just in the US or Europe.\\n\\nSo in order to support *essential* functions-- food, safety, water-- with *just* renewables, everyone needs to cut back on *everything* nonessential.\\n\\nWhat\\'s nonessential?\\n\\nThe entire fashion industry. The entire beauty industry. The entire landscaping industry. The vast majority of the travel industry. The toy industry. Much of the residential construction industry. 99% of the packaged goods industry (how many brands of shampoo, soap, cereal, candy, soda pop, snack chips, frozen meals, cake mix, etc. do we really *need*). The meat industry. The dairy industry. The party supply industry. Much of the electronics industry. The HGTV-granite-counter-top home remodeling industry. The jewelry industry. Pretty much any store at a mall.\\n\\nAnd last, **but certainly not least**, the military industrial complex.\\n\\nWe have ten years. This is no exaggeration. In order for human civilization to exist sustainably with the food, water, shelter to support everyone-- using only renewables-- all this other shit that didn\\'t exist 150 years ago has got to disappear.\\n\\nMaybe permanently.\\n\\nOh, and we need a 4-day (or even 3-day) work week, so everyone can have a job, but without all the traffic jams and electricity being burned up. Shit needs to be closed down and people stay home and play board games more often. So there\\'s that, too.\\n\\nSo yeah, \"adults\" are frightened. Heads of state who have any brains are frightened. Billionaires who can see ten years ahead are frightened.\\n\\nThe ones who only care about their own lifetimes are fighting the change that needs to happen. The ones who fear the societal unrest the change will bring are fighting change. The ones who can\\'t conceptualize a world without a growing GDP are fighting tooth and nail against the change.\\n\\nAnd the super terrified ones?

You can seriously make a huge impact beyond your wildest dreams and do so CONVENIENTLY and with little or no discernible change in your habits. Remember though, you need to get your message and support to the producers.\\n\\nBrazil produces nearly 60MM bags of coffee annually, which is around 40% of all the coffee produced in the world. This includes varieties of Arabica and Robusta, high end and low end, and everything in-between. Though single origin, small estate coffees from Brazil are there, they are not all the rage in the specialty market. Instead, coffees for specialty blends (like for your local roasters espresso blend for example) and commercial blends (think your Folgers and Tim Hortons) are the primary movers and shakers. There are exceptions, but we're talking 1-2% of the Brazilian coffee market is the top stuff. The rest is commercial or for blends.\\n\\nThe sway Brazil has over coffee is so drastic, that reports of bad or good weather can affect the entire futures markets for coffee sold on in NY (the ICE or C Future for Arabica) and in London (for Robusta prices). So who to look to?\\n\\nBig Players\\n\\n* JAB Holdings, Nestle (yeah...they won't give a shit will they), Starbucks, and Lavazza are the dominant forces who control a substantial chunk of the green coffee importing business. Call your MPS and demand some action here, as these big folks are only going to bend to policy changes, sanctions (we use them to punish rogue states, why not rogue environmental states?), etc.\\n\\nMid Level Players\\n\\n* Green Coffee Sellers. They sell to roasters. In the US (for whom I can speak to) are Olam, Cafe Imports, Ally Coffee (mainly Brazils), InterAmerican, Atlas, and some other small folks. Our folks who roast their own might recognize both Mr. Green Bean and Sweet Marias. CALL THEM. Tell them you will not purchase Brazilian coffee and ask for substitutes.\\n* The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) and other trade organizations. The SCA includes many guilds like the Roaster's Guild, Barista's Guild of America, etc, and spans the globe. Contact them. Express outrage. If you are going to an SCA event or a World Barista Championship...SPEAK OUT!\\n\\nLow-Level Players\\n\\n* Your local coffee shop and roaster. Don't just avoid Brazilian coffee, ask what the single origin is and get it. Your mind will likely be blown by what espresso is available or that regional offering rather than the standard breakfast blend. Tell the barista/roaster/owner WHY you don't want Brazil. Encourage them to get involved.\\n\\nWhy could this be stupid easy and result in absolutely no inconvenience to you, the busy consumer? There is a crap ton of amazing and well-priced coffees out there that blow Brazilian coffee out of the water. El Salvador? Yep. Guatemala? Sure. Some really nice stuff coming out of Peru these days and Honduras?

They are if you  look at the cumulative emissions in the period 1988 - 2015. However, in  2015 the 224 most emitting companies where responsible for 72 % GHG  emissions. 100 or 224 companies, I guess that is not really the point.\\n\\nWhat  type of companies are these? All are fossil fuel producers. So, they  are not really making your products, except most of the energy we use.  So, if you have a car, use electricity or buy ANYTHING, good luck  boycotting.\\n\\nAre these companies  really doing the emissions? Well yes, about 10 % of it. The remaining 90  % is downstream emissions. So if Shell or BP drills up oil and someone  uses the oil in their car the emissions will be attributed to Shell, and  not the driver.\\n\\nIs this 71 % of  ALL anthropogenic emissions? No, this excludes non-industrial sources,  mainly land-use, agriculture and forestry. I don\\'t know exactly how this  is accounted, but this excludes about 25 % of GHG emissions. So the  gain from veganism is not in this number. So the real number might be  about 54 % of anthropogenic emissions, but again I don’t know how this  would be accounted. So, in summary 224 companies are directly  responsible for 5.4 % of anthropogenic emissions, or 54 % direct +  indirect.\\n\\nI do not want to make  excuses for these companies, i just want people too to be informed. So,  if people reduce their energy consumption these companies will reduce  their emissions too.\\n\\nSo what can  you do about this list? Not sure. If you have lots of money to invest,  you can use your power. Many people have lots of money in their  retirement savings, I think this is where people have the most direct  power. Reducing your energy use will also work. But this list is best  utilised by investors.\\n\\nIf I have misunderstood anything, please let me know.  \\n(i have posted this elsewhere)',\n",

It would not only help lower the amount of public transportation vehicles needed but it would be good for our health. Of course emergency vehicles (for example police cars, firefighters, ambulances ect...) would still be occupied and could benefit from this for example cops could focus less on traffic control maybe and focus more on solving crimes and stopping them also they would be able  to respond quicker (hopefully) However I'm not sure how this would impact the economy, like would the price of public transportation rise?

Some of these are expensive to do, some of them are easy to do no matter what your income is.\\n\\n\\n*Easy stuff:*\\n\\n\\n**Turn off your outdoor house lights at night.** Google 'Dark Sky movement' to understand why. Basically a lot of insects and life depend on their natural circadian rhythm. Let's stop messing around with that.\\n\\n**If you have a cat as a pet, keep it indoors.** Cats are an invasive species and hunt down whatever they can get...especially song birds. There's a lot of sing birds that have declining numbers and cats contribute to this. Keep your cats inside.\\n\\n**Don't purchase useless products.** \\nThink of that show with Marie Kondo and purchase/keep stuff that you give some real thought about; if you deduce that product as improving your life, then great! If not, don't bother. Buy used stuff where possible.\\n\\n**Inform your local municipalities to adopt new by-laws.** \\nPropose new regulations/bylaws for tree cutting. Inform your municipalities to bring in cat control bylaws similar to existing dog control bylaws.\\n\\n**Recommend your state or provincial government of new regulation.**\\nPropose to regulate and ban the selling of invasive and non-native vegetation at nurseries and landscape companies. Propose the banning of pesticides. Propose tax credits to home-owners and farmers to plant native plants/trees.\\n\\n**Tell your non-right leaning friends and family to watch the documentary.**\\nDo not waste your time and effort trying to convince hard right-leaning family members. It's crushing to attempt it...I hate to generalize but red-necks and boomers are pretty stubborn and have lived comfortable lives. They don't want to change that. Educate people who are already more progressive or even centrist. They are usually more open-minded and intelligent.\\n\\n\\n*Medium Level stuff:*\\n\\n\\n**Minimize eating meat.** \\nYou don't have to stop eating meat, but try eating meat once a week or so...make the change gradually and its hardly noticeable.\\n\\n**Buy food from local markets and buy organic where possible.** \\nWe need to stop supporting pesticide based agriculture.\\n\\n**Do your research on native plant species in your area and plant them on your property**\\nDo your research on identifying invasive species and remove them when you see them. Plant native (to your area) plant species on your property instead.\\n\\n\\n*Difficult/Costly stuff:*\\n\\n\\n**Get rid of the gas powered utilities in your house:**\\n\\n* Replace your gas stove with induction or electric (induction is best, but expensive). \\n* Replace your gas furnace with electric air handler plus replace your A/C with a heat pump. Heat Pump + Air handler is a very efficient combination. Slightly more costly up-front.\\n* Replace your gas dryer with an electric dryer. We actually hang our clothes in our basement over the winter. We do not have a dryer at all.\\n\\n\\n**Replace your aging or high mileage car with an electric car** \\nThis should be your main savings priority even above the house stuff - petroleum based energy is worse than natural gas.\\n\\n**Replace your shingles with solar shingles or add panels**\\nTesla's solar shingles still haven't yet ramped up to full production but it will probably happen in the next few years.\\n\\n**Consider having less or no kids** \\nI put this one here as some people find this a touchy subject. Was an easy decision for us though.\\n\\n**Donate money to local, state, provincial charities that support the environment and conservation of natural areas.** \\nWe donate to a Provincial nature charity and National charity that actually does lobbying too, which is awesome. We also donate to progressive political parties and Land Trusts (Land Trusts are usually run by environmental experts/hobbyists and they actively purchase existing natural land or farmland and re-naturalize it. Land Trusts are amazing and I get teary-eyed just thinking about how awesome our local one is).\\n\\n**Minimize air travel.**\\nI put this here as some people find big vacations as a mandatory lifestyle choice. It is a choice after all, so choose to do less international travel (COVID making this easy). Travel by train or car to places within your own country that you would love to visit. For now try to stay home, due to COVID though! Also, minimizing air travel will save you quite a bit of money that you can put towards electrifying your house or purchasing an electric car.\",\n",

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.\\n\\n“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.”\\n\\nThe scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.\\n“There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.”\\nThe signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.\\n\\n“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,” they note. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”\\n“If better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world,” they state.\\nIn particular, the scientists criticize the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is currently founded as “unfit for their purpose.”\\n“Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models,” they propose. “Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.”\\n“We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,” they declare.',\n",

Ark itself has Mrs Wood at the helm so win for their G but also recently took a huge position in Palantir who have admitted to their platform being used to kill people so knock on the S; they also have a position in Draft Kings- how do you feel about gambling and/or Dave Potnoy. From an E stand point their biggest win was their early bet on Tesla and they have other evehicles which help to wash their environmental standards.  \\nWhich brings me to point two, using Tesla as the example. The companies they are investing in may have a good ESG standing but that is not WHY they invest. Also, while TSLA has a great E, his Technoking-ness is far from woke on the S & G elements (unsafe working conditions, forcing workers back to work where they contracted covid so he could hit is bonus,  his brother is a mainstay of the board,  etc.)\\nThis is where it comes down to what you want from your acronym. If you simply want to avoid serious carbon assets then disruptive tech by its current nature does pretty well. (Which incidentally is how a lot of these ESG funds do so well,  high percentage allocation to tech like FB, Microsoft, Tesla, etc because of thier \"low carbon footprint\" you know, because they are tech stocks...) However if you are looking for a more well rounded ESG or companies/investment firms that are actively pursuing ESG initiatives to better humanity, bring equality to the board room,  have social justice initiatives,  name your series of factors then Ark is not for you. \\nThe question is are you good simply because you are not bad or is being good an active pursuit?',\n",

Indeed, the best I\\'ve heard is \"socially responsible investing is whatever the investor believes it is.\" For me, the best example of this is Shell. Oil producing companies can\\'t be green can they? Well, most esg scores are comparing a company to its overall industry so it may well come out looking very green. They also invest in renewables so depending on the screens used it may look like a green investment. \\n\\nThere were a few WSJ investigations and found that there were essentially zero correlation between esg scores of one provider compared to another, and that many funds had just changed their name to include the word\" green\" or \"sustainable\" etc without changing the portfolio.\\n\\nTheoretically speaking, imagine a company like PG Tips. How can one accurately or precisely estimate its environmental impact? Are they going to annually sample their farms, their HQ for water usage etc? And then consider that PG Tips\\' score will get augmented with all the other Unilever subsidiaries into one value. It seems like an absurd task to me.\\n\\nCrucially, large caps like the Vanguard one will contain almost the same as a normal world index, but likely have higher fees. I wouldn\\'t recommend it imo, and go for a big standard world index with low fees.\\n\\nI would also note that you\\'re investing in the secondary market - unless the company is issuing shares (v unlikely) then your investment won\\'t have a direct impact. ESG investing is all about incentivising management to act ethically - the Church of England have shares in Amazon, for example, to lobby for workers\\' rights.

I think that they had a legitimate point that the claims made by some of the funds are not clear and/or hard to validate. However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. \\n\\nThere was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

The cell manufacturers typically have a boiler plate agreement to take back their battery modules at end of life. Most EV companies (excluding Tesla) are unlikely to bring cell manufacturing in house so I'd be suspicious of Li-Cycle getting access to that 'manufacturing scrap' they call out on slide 13. \\n\\nAlso the comp slide (slide 31) is kind of a mess.

For one thing, when you buy a stock (unlike when you buy a product), almost all the time you are getting the stock from another investor on the secondary market and aren’t giving any money to the company itself. That means selling a company’s stock is not like refusing to buy its products; it’s more like refusing to buy used products made by that company and sold by someone else. You at most indirectly hurt the company by making its stock price go down, and I doubt ESG investing will ever be big enough to accomplish that, especially because an unethical company that is underpriced should attract more investment from profit-maximizing investors. Potentially, a very rich person or fund could try to get so many shares that they can have significant voting rights and then direct the company to be more ethical, but at that point they are not really investing in the ordinary person sense.\\n\\nFor another thing, it’s really hard to know what companies are actually ethical, and outsourcing this to a manager is questionable too because the manager may have different ethics than you.

The rest is sourced directly via links in the text. Please watch the video first, as it is necessary context for this post.**\\n\\nESG investing yields lower returns compared to non-ESG funds in the same sectors and exposed to the same factors (like small cap, growth, etc.) This is theoretically justified and historically evident. The reasons have nuance but let me put it simply: When a large (but not unanimous) portion of the market is receiving a consumptive good benefit (i.e., you are getting a social, personal, or psychological reward) for investing in a certain kind of asset, or excluding a certain kind of asset, then the price of that asset will be higher than a comparable asset that carries no such benefit. This means you overpay and have lower expected future returns. The inverse is also true: If you pay a non-financial cost for investing in a certain asset, you will underbuy that asset, and thus it will be cheaper. Think about the social, psychological, or reputational costs you might incur for telling your friends, neighbors, teachers, or political allies that you invest in private prison companies. When this dynamic is at play for some, but not all of the market, the portion of the market that is doing the \"ESG investing\" is by definition expecting lower future returns. This fact is unavoidable from an economic lens, and has been confirmed empirically.\\n\\nFelix in the video also goes into more depth about other adjacent reasons that this must hold. One is the fact that there is, of course, a level of return differential between ESG and non-ESG investing that would cause even the most fervent ESG investors to stop ESG investing, and this fact alone means that non-ESG investing has a higher expected return. Also, the MORE people invest in ESG, the LOWER the expected return for someone buying in or holding those assets becomes. Some people are tempted to think to themselves, \"I\\'ll buy ESG funds in the hopes that in the future, more people than ever buy ESG funds\" but this is an explicit greater-fool theory of investing that -never works for the majority who participate in it, by definition.- With 25% of US stock money being in ESG funds (and 50% of Canadian $!), who is really the fool? When the top suggested ETFs by the entire internet tend to be explicit ESG plays like clean energy ETFs and ARK funds, where are you on the fool continuum for buying or holding those assets? Greater-fool speculative market timing doesn\\'t work, but what you can be sure of, in this circumstance, is that you are buying overpriced equities that will depress future returns when things return to their fundamentals...this is a logically necessary, unavoidable implication if fund flows are determining price increases!\\n\\nOne might point out, \"but look how good X industry has done! Clean energy has outperformed fossil fuels!\" This is a tempting response, but the researchers aren\\'t stupid. Certain factors are always outperforming other factors, and in this case, growth companies and tech companies have been on an incredible run. The authors -already control- for sector, size, momentum, value/growth, investment, profitability, and so on. When you control for all of that, then look specifically at the differences between two batches of companies that are equivalent in every financially relevant way, but one has ESG designations and one doesn\\'t, the ESG underperforms. ESG funds are indeed in sectors and factors that have outperformed, but they UNDERPERFORMED relative to non-ESG holdings in those same sectors and factors. ESG-ness itself turns out to be a net harm to returns both in theory and in practice.\\n\\nThe other aspects of the costs of ESG investing are even simpler and surely unlikely to be doubted, but I\\'ll quickly say them again. The fees of ESG funds are higher than the fees of other diversified market-weight index funds and targeted factor funds. The turnover is higher as well. Also, the difference in diversification is obvious...a subset of the market is never as diversified as the entire market. To remind people of the benefit of diversification: When you lower your diversification substantially, you raise your risk, raise your volatility, and increase uncertainty about future returns...and, crucially, lowering diversification does not increase your expected future returns. William F. Sharpe won a Nobel Prize in part for proving that you do not get paid for taking more risk when the risk can be diversified away. So not only does lowering diversification not increase future returns, in the case of ESG, it reduces your future returns as well.\\n\\nAnother aspect of ESG investing not covered in the video but more than worth mentioning, is that ESG stocks tend to be in the category of stocks that have the -lowest historical and expected returns of the entire market-. The authors of the study control this away in order to isolate ESG-ness, but let me also share the factor information of the companies you are buying into. These companies tend to be growth stocks, almost all of them are unprofitable, and they are biased toward being small, and they exhibit high positive skewness (they have a higher-than-normal chance to have massive returns). Small cap, unprofitable growth stocks are the [Black Hole of Investing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avoid-the-black-hole-of-investing/). From the [Lottery Ticket Effect](https://www.etf.com/sections/index-investor-corner/swedroe-investors-prefer-gambling-stocks?nopaging=1) where investors consistently overpay for stocks that have a higher chance of massive short term returns, leading to lower total average returns, to the fact that [they have liquidity problems and are difficult to short](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedroe-rediscovering-size-effect-233000204.html), leading to prices being set systematically higher than they should because the market is unable to knock them down, ESG investing biases toward market segments that are are bad, bad, bad, and bad. Not to mention, [\"technological revolution\" investing tends to be a loser\\'s game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k), with prices being very prone to bubble behavior and consistent overpricing and lower returns relative to declining industries. I\\'ll say it again, recent massive overperformance of ESG industries/factors is not a counterargument here...it is just further reason to believe that you are not getting a deal or buying/holding underpriced stocks.\\n\\nESG investing is the -opposite- of a free lunch. It harms your portfolio in just about every way that a portfolio can be harmed. If more people interested in ESG investing knew this, I suspect they may think twice about whether they are willing to sacrifice so much [for so little, if any positive impact on the world.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18136214/impact-investing-socially-responsible-sri-report) Consider keeping your portfolio invested rationally, with low cost total market indexes, potentially biased toward higher expected return assets in the market, like small cap value (AVUV, SLYV, AVDV) or emerging market stocks (VWO,AVEM), and then simply donating the money you can afford to the objectively most cost effective charities in the world, such as those identified by [https://www.givewell.org/](https://www.givewell.org/) and [https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) . Perhaps taking the profits from the \"sin stocks\" and reinvesting them effectively to help the world could preserve both your portfolio and the sense of purpose that many get from ESG.',\n",

       "              1547051416.0,\n",
       "              ' Mr. Speaker, \\n\\nI come once again to comment on this bill. In the last reading, I expressed both a fundamental doubt regarding the concept of the bill and also an amendable, resolvable doubt about the language of it. I am sorry to say that neither have been assuaged.\\n\\nWith regards to the fundamental doubt, this would have to be the idea of restraining investment opportunities to start with. I am inclined to believe that the main goal of these funds should be to increase the rate of return on investment, as this benefits all of us as the public. We depend on these funds, workers depend on these funds. Yet, if they do not maximise returns, then it seems to me that they will become less efficient and harm all who depend on them. Furthermore, it also creates the chance of accruing losses over time as the funds become more emburdened by stringent guidelines and restraining rules. This should be an unacceptable risk to take in my opinion, since the costs could be large. However, when my Friend posed a question regarding these costs to the Deputy Prime Minister, instead of giving a clear, honest answer, he dodged it completely. This action did no favours in convincing me that this government neither knows what it is even doing with this bill nor has an understanding of the tangible consequences of it upon our country’s various funds. So on this count, I will oppose this bill. As an idea, perhaps it would be better to try and stamp out the undesirable activities directly through international and domestic rules and systems instead of relying on restraining and weakening our own crucial funds. I would see this method as one which reconciles all desires here, but it is one that this government has not opted to take.\\n\\nMr. Speaker, I also remember this bill as being generally imprecise with language and incorrect in application. Indeed, there is a significant, systematic  issue within the bill when the term ‘ethical’ is bandied about but no definition or clarification is added specifying it. So, in committee I did what I saw was my obligation in the face of almost certain passage of this bill by the government—no matter how poorly written the final product would be. I put forth multiple amendments which based the language of this bill on more solid foundations and real documents. Using this approach I believed, and still do believe, it made a better piece of legislation in the end because less of the bill’s application would be informed by some highly amorphous concept of ethics from each person who enforces this bill. People who manage our funds should have firm standards set into law simply because without guidelines, management of these critical funds will become more arbitrary and less predictable. Stability and consistent standards are essential for the sound management of critical state funds, and I had thought that this was an argument that all would have come to accept. Indeed, with these amendments any vote in favour would not have violated the coalition agreement nor would it have softened this bill. Yet, these amendments, save the one to Schedule 1, failed to pass and this also serves as a reason to oppose this bill. We cannot tolerate the imprecise language here since it could create unacceptable costs in the same vein as those derived from the restrictions to begin with. While I celebrate the acceptance of the amendment to Schedule 1, an amendment which fixes many of the bill’s flaws, it does not go far enough in rectifying the bill’s problems with vagueness. On this count, too, I will oppose this bill.\\n\\nMr. Speaker, I will vote against this bill unfortunately. I had hoped to be able to support it for the final reading but it will not be possible due to the failure to resolve serious doubts and preventable errors. I encourage my fellow MPs to do the same.',\n",

This bill is about ensuring that our Crown investment agencies don\\'t try to profit off of pain, misery, and suffering. This bill is about ensuring that ethical investment criteria is set in law, not just reliant on whether or not the current Superannuation fund guardians believe it\\'s a good idea or not. It\\'s also about streamlining this minimum criteria across all our Crown investment agencies.\\n\\nUp and down New Zealand, we are seeing consumers place more and more value on ethical conduct and sustainability. Companies are forced to take positive steps to reducing their environmental impact, people care more about purchasing fair trade products, and the like. People care about the impact their money has on the world around them. Our Crown investment agencies must be receptive to that demand as they invest taxpayer money, and use our money wisely on the international market, as consumers do at the supermarket. We owe it to consumers to make the obligations of our Crown investment agencies crystal clear in our statute books\\n\\nWe cannot bandy around our \"100% pure NZ\" slogan whilst investing in companies that actively destroy the environment. I know the National Party wants to have their cake and eat it too, but we can\\'t pretend to be environmental leaders by investing in environmental destruction. We can\\'t pretend to be responsible global citizens whilst financing the global arms trade. We can\\'t be a nuclear-free nation if we invest in companies that produce nuclear weapons. It\\'s this two hats mentality, that it\\'s out of sight and out of mind, which we must reject.\\n\\nWe must move from a passive position on ethics and sustainability and take a more active role. The opposition is scared of putting our money where out mouth is as a nation, and that doesn\\'t surprise anyone. This is a courageous step forward, marking the interests of New Zealand loud and clear on the world stage.\\n\\nI must note it\\'s quite ironic to hear National members accuse this government of trying to \\'railroad through\\' legislation, considering the last government\\'s abuses of urgency, rushing through unpopular legislation at the last minute without any chance for public oversight. No, this government still stands for transparency and accountability, following through with the appropriate parliamentary procedure, and most importantly, listening to voters. Perhaps that explains why they\\'re in opposition.\\n\\nNevertheless, I commend this principled and forward-thinking bill to the house, a bill that prioritises New Zealand\\'s interests as an ethical and sustainability-focussed nation, soundly rejecting the opposition\\'s penchant for environmental destruction.',\n",

As far as I’m aware, the sovereign wealth fund does not invest in companies will produce or sell nuclear weapons. It also seeks to ban investment in illegal activities - forgive me for asking, but does the Minister think these illegal poachers or lumber mills are floating stocks on the markets? Does he believe that these immoral groups release their cash flow and operating revenue before going into Cambodia to cut down trees?\\n\\nWhat’s more - the bill seeks to propose a ban on gold and oil extraction which involves “unacceptable” environmental damage - will the Minister be founding a body to adjudicate on these issues?\\n\\nAgain on this issue - why is investment in the extraction of gold to be banned if it is “unacceptable”, but not other minerals such as silver, zinc, or lead, which may employ the exact same methods in harvesting ore?\\n\\nMr. Speaker, this Bill is a shoddy piece of work and the Minister needs to rewrite it or withdraw it entirely.

       "              \"Mr Speaker,\\n\\nThis bill perhaps has good intent but as it is the bill before this House promises to lead this nation to ruin. As I fear that it will pass this initial reading, I call on Members of Parliament to work on writing up amendments to it posthaste.\\n\\nFirst, let us point out the elephant in the room here; a savings fund is meant to bring the most return to its trustees in the determined period of time. By putting restrictions on the management of personal savings, as is the case of KiwiSaver, or the Government Superannuation Fund, meant for our hard-working state sector employees, this government opens up the possibility for these funds to be more reliant on worse investments. Not only does this directly undermine the idea of the funds serving those who benefit from it, it also opens up risk within this funds. With worse investments, it means that more of them will likely become loss-making and therefore increase the chance that the funds remain healthy, safe ways for our citizens and state sector employees to rely on. It really is irresponsible the way that the government currently pursues a policy with such disregard for both the financial health of individuals and those it directly hires.\\n\\nNow, Mr Speaker, I'd like to address the issues related to the terms of the bill. We see the terms 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' littered about, but what does it actually mean? Luckily the Minister for Foreign Affairs has put these sections in next to ones which actually do have meaning, but as it is the term 'ethical' in this bill is just pandering and meaningless because it is undefined and left for the bureaucrats who enforce the bill to determine. Do we want unelected people to determine what is ethical on behalf of the country? I am not so sure. \\n\\nAs for the stricter guidelines in this bill found in Schedule 1, there are multiple glaring issues there as well. There is the awkwardly-worded phrase 'investments will not invest in investments involved in', one which lacks clarity whatsoever. The use of 'involved' also begs the question, what does it mean to be 'involved'? The bill must define this lest bureaucrats determine with levity what 'involvement' exactly means. Even if no other amendment passes, this part must be fixed or there will be no comprehensible reading of this bill. The bill also condemns those firms dealing with the 'manufacture of addictive substances'. May I ask what substances in particular? As written this bill could cause our funds to direct investment away from companies that make everything from video games to chocolate pudding! It needs more clarity once again. Then this bill brings up legality and human rights, one of the most unclear issues of them all here. What's an 'illegal activity' exactly? Is it just an environmental crime such as poaching or could it be any crime under any law? Could chewing gum be an 'illegal activity' under this bill since it's prohibited in Singapore? The Minister who presented this bill ought to define what is and is not illegal. In Schedule 1, (1)(e) also raises questions. Why are unconstitutional statuses necessarily negative and what qualifies as repressive? Furthermore, most countries, including this one, violate human rights of some sort. I say this again: this bill cannot be accepted without more clarification. Yes, these terms in Schedule 1 are just meant to be guidelines. These guidelines must be clear and sound however, because so many of our citizens and state sector employees depend on these funds for their savings. For such a topic of high-importance, vague suggestions should not be tolerated.\\n\\nMr Speaker, I ask that the Deputy Prime Minister withdraw this bill and rewrite it himself. Otherwise, substantive revision must occur in the amendment reading. If neither of these things happen, it ought to be rejected outright by this House, for the sake of the people's interest. \",\n",

       "              \"Kia ora, Mr Speaker. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou, kia ora.\\n\\nMr Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, because the Green Party is and has always been a vocal supporter of ethical, responsible, and sustainable investment.\\n\\nThere are a couple of objectives to this bill, effectively. The first is to make capital cheaper and more available to businesses that are acting responsibly, ethically, and sustainably. That's about using our government funds, whether New Zealand First's KiwiFund, the Cullen Fund, or the ACC fund, to support business that aren't destroying the planet, that aren't acting unethically- we want them to prosper. And conversely, for businesses that are acting unethically and inappropriately, for them we want to make capital more expensive and less available.\\n\\nThe second underlying objective is to ensure New Zealand, as a country, lives and acts in a way that is ethical and responsible. It is no surprise that, for example, numerous KiwiSaver providers adhere to some ethical investment criteria, or at least provide an ethical option. We want to be living off these funds in a way that is socially responsible, that will shift the world in a more ethical and sustainable and humane direction.\\n\\nIt took years of effort to fight the unethical investments of the Cullen fund, and even today the fund still remains invested in numerous things that we, as a nation, should not be backing, and should not be trying to profit off. The Greens campaigned to get the fund out of whale meat, tobacco, and cluster funds, which was successful, but today still the fund is invested in Rio Tinto and Freeport-McMoRan, two of the largest mining companies, causing irreparable environmental damage to both land and our climate- and of course, climate change is a global issue. The fund is invested in Gazprom, the third worst industrial carbon dioxide emitter in the world. ExxonMobil, the fourth worst. The fund is invested in Halliburton, the company who profiteered off of the Iraq war. BAE Systems,  United Technologies Corp, Rolls-Royce, Babcock International, Safran- all involved in the production of nuclear weapons, and all financed by the Cullen fund. We can learn from Norway, who's pension fund has sensible ethical criteria, and is not involved with so many of the unethical and irresponsible firms that our various funds are invested in.\\n\\nMr Speaker, this bill will steer New Zealand and it's investments in a direction that is ethical and responsible. That is responsible foreign policy, that is responsible human rights policy, and it is a policy that I am proud to see put forward to the house.\\n\\nNgā mihi.\",\n",

I always tell them they should learn what it really means to buy a stock.  \\n\\nLet's say there is a company called Cat Fucker Incorporated.  I really like cats and I certainly don't want to see any cats harmed.  But let's say that Cat Fucker Inc. has been a publically traded company for a long time now, and I see evidence that the industry is about to explode and that the company is about to do very well.  \\n\\nBeing a wise investor I will buy shares of Cat Fucker and hopefully later sell those shares to another investor for a profit.  \\n\\nWhat does that mean?  Will I be giving money to Cat Fucker Incorporated?  Absolutely not!  I will be giving money to somebody else, probably somebody just like me that once believed it was a good idea to own shares in the company.  Maybe they would be profiting from my purchase, or maybe they would be selling it for a loss.  The Cat Fucker people made money from those shares long ago during its IPO.  I'm not giving anything to them.  \\n\\nIn fact, only the actual CUSTOMERS of Cat Fucker Inc. are enabling the company to make money.  Stocks follow earnings, or perceived future earnings.  \\n\\nSo if you are concerned about companies that do harm to the world vote with you wallet and don't spend money on their products.

You are NOT contributing in any way to the things the companies do (that includes companies that do GOOD things too!)\\n\\nIf you invest wisely you can earn money and use that money to help the world.

Hate to say it, but ESG is just another one. \\n\\nPeople forget this even though it should be obvious, but all hedge funds/mutual funds/PE firms/VC firms have short/medium/long term marketing plans. There are marketing and business development people whose job it is to take the temperature of the world and make sure the firm is positioned properly. \\n\\nFor example, for the last ~5 years, *everything* is ‘quant’-this and ‘quant’-that. Did funds *really* change their strats? Fuck no. What they did was pay some data aggregator $1M for data access and hire some guy with a MS in statistics to crunch data, *and then went back to doing what they were already doing.* The stat guys job is to provide a ‘quant’ rationale for a decision after the fact. Occasionally, they *might* add some a priori ideas to the ‘investment mix’. \\n\\nI’m saying this bc I’ve worked buyside structures credit for over 10 years are we are *very* quant focused (yeah, I was a quant before it was cool) - but my peers and I laugh at what other firms try to get away with under the guise of ‘quant driven’.\\n\\nNow to ESG - we have a great marketing/BD teams and we are already trying to figure out how to pitch our funds as having an ESG focus without changing our process. For example, I’m already into an energy credit trade - fossil fuels are the opposite of ‘ESG’, right? So I’ll have a junior go find me a way to frame the trade. The credit we bought comes from an oil company that invests a tiny bit in renewables? Perfect! “We chose this credit for both the risk oppy AND due to our commitment to supporting companies the focuses on ESG.” In reality I didn’t change shit. This was the same with ‘quant’, ‘woman focused’, ‘Corp governance’, ‘Corp social responsibility’ etc. \\n\\nTLDR: ESG is a marketing phrase and little more.

I work closely with the UN on financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) which recently recognised me as one of 50+ industry leaders worldwide. I am NOT a public markets expert, nor do I know absolutely everything about impact investing. This industry is fast moving, and I learn something new everyday.\\n\\n**PRIMER:** The image that I linked to this post is the responsible investing spectrum. I’ve found it to be a very good primer when discussing impact investing and how it positions itself versus other types of investments. To summarize the spectrum in plain English:\\n\\n* **Traditional investing**: Does not take into account Environmental, Social or Governance (ESG) considerations when making an investment decision. These types of investors only focus on financial returns.\\n* **Responsible investing**: These investors take into account ESG in their risk mitigation strategy. Roughly 25% (roughly $20 Trillion) of all professionally managed assets around the world take into account ESG when making an investment decision (i.e the orange “ESG risk management” bar on the image). Based on existing commitments, it is expected that this percentage will rise to roughly 75% of assets under management (AUM) by 2030 (NEED TO ADD CITATION)\\n\\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#430d6f2d1695](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#430d6f2d1695)\\n\\n[https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/the-rise-of-responsible-investment-fs.html](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/the-rise-of-responsible-investment-fs.html)\\n\\n* **Sustainable / socially responsible investing:** These types of investors don’t just see ESG issues as a risk to mitigate, but they believe that ESG can create opportunities for the companies.\\n* **Impact Investing:** Impact investing is defined as “Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. Impact investing can be split into two categories depending on the financial returns targeted:\\n\\no **Theme based impact investing** (this is what I do)**:** These types of investors seek market rate returns alongside the positive impact generated by their investments.\\n\\no **Impact First investing:** These investors are willing to sacrifice some financial return in the hopes of generating more impact; basically have a higher impact per dollar.\\n\\n* **Philanthropy:** These investors either seek capital preservation (no returns) or offer grants and loss capital (negative returns). I know it looks really weird to put philanthropy on an investment spectrum, and in most cases I would not consider what they do as investing, however when it comes to impact investing these people often play a key role in **blended finance** investments. In these types of investments, the philanthropic capital provide a first loss guarantee / transfer their pro rata returns to other investors; thus derisking the investment opportunity for other investors and catalysing more capital to address the social, economic or environmental issue that they are trying to address.\\n\\n[http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/blended-finance.htm](http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/blended-finance.htm)\\n\\n**KEY FACTS & FIGURES:**\\n\\nA lot of the information here comes from various studies published by the GIIN, you can find them here : [https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/](https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/)\\n\\n\\\\- Size of the market: $502 Billion in 2018. It is expected that the global impact investing market has reached $1 Trillion in 2019\\n\\n\\\\- About two-thirds of investors seek market-rate returns (66%), and the remaining third are split between those targeting returns closer to market rate (19%) and those targeting returns closer to capital preservation (15%).\\n\\nAs a side note, the vast majority (roughly 90%) of studies show that investments that incorporate ESG analysis outperform non-ESG investments in the long term. This is probably why such a large portion of the financial industry is switching over to ESG strategies.\\n\\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/22/does-esg-investing-produce-better-stock-returns.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/22/does-esg-investing-produce-better-stock-returns.aspx)\\n\\n[https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/195919/esg-funds-beat-non-sustainable-sister-funds.aspx](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/195919/esg-funds-beat-non-sustainable-sister-funds.aspx)\\n\\n**COMMON QUESTIONS / COMMENTS:**\\n\\n**What is the difference between a strong ESG company and an impact company?** For an impact company the impact scales with the size of the business (i.e impact generation IS the business plan), whereas for an ESG company that relationship does not necessarily hold true. For example, Coca cola scores quite well in ESG issues thanks to their sustainable supply chains, good governance etc. but at the end of the day their core business is drinks to people, so selling more doesn\\\\`t automatically mean they are generating more impact. A renewable energy company however generates impact from its core operations.\\n\\n**Is impact investing in public markets possible?** Historically impact investing has been private investments (debt and equity) since investors have much more control over the company’s impact generation. In my personal opinion, the majority of impact investing in public markets is baloney since investment managers follow a top down investment approach of successive screening. The best (and hardest) way to do impact investing in public markets is bottom up where you go from impact themes, look for companies that operate in those themes, identify the tope performing ones and invest. The best example I have found on the market of this is the Wellington Asset Management Impact strategy.\\n\\n[https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm\\\\_referrer=https://www.google.ca/](https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm_referrer=https://www.google.ca/)\\n\\n**Does impact investing actually generate the expected returns?** The link below is an oldy but goody (2017 with 2016 data). But long story short, yes the financial returns of impact investments are in line with their non impact peers for both market rate & below market rate investment strategies.\\n\\n[https://thegiin.org/assets/2017\\\\_GIIN\\\\_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments\\\\_Web.pdf](https://thegiin.org/assets/2017_GIIN_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments_Web.pdf)\\n\\n**Given it's a subset of the market, why do you think you are finding similar risk adjusted returns? Is it primarily due to government subsidy?**  For non-blended investments, I would argue that there are a few things driving returns:\\n\\n\\\\- More information = better investment decision making : when you're looking at a company / fund from an impact perspective, you're asking a lot more detailed questions about the business and you're getting much more familiar with the market.\\n\\n\\\\- Different investment opportunities : when you have a bottom up approach where you start from the problem you want to address then look for companies / solutions in that space, you find investment opportunities & strategies that nobody else / very few people have thought of. Given the glut of capital in the markets right now looking for investable opportunities, having fewer people around the table allows to to make better deals.\\n\\n**This is a whole load of impact-washing / green-washing baloney:**  This is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and the reason why organisations like the GIIN, UN etc. are working so hard to have proper industry standards for impact measurement, management and communication. A lot of progress has been made over the past year however with the launch of IRIS+ by the GIIN and the SDG certification framework by the UN.\\n\\n [https://iris.thegiin.org/](https://iris.thegiin.org/) \\n\\n [https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2019/UNDP\\\\_launches\\\\_standards\\\\_to\\\\_guide\\\\_private\\\\_sector\\\\_in\\\\_achieving\\\\_SDGs.html](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2019/UNDP_launches_standards_to_guide_private_sector_in_achieving_SDGs.html) \\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI'll try to update this post as questions / comments come in, or as I have the time to add links to relevant studies & articles.

At the micro level, this is easily understood: violent crime and destruction of property is bad, cleanliness and friendly neighbours are good.  People understand what it looks like to benefit the community at the micro level because direct causal relationships are super simple.\\n\\nAt the macro level, things get hazy.\\n\\nIs a company that provides a means for people in the community to convert labour into productivity at the cost of polluting the local water supply good?  Is a needle exchange that provides shelter for addicts but makes them visible to the community bad?\\n\\nGovernment and taxation enters the picture here as a solution to that question.  Because it\\'s difficult for a larger entity to comprehensively comport themselves in a manner which unequivocally \"benefits the community\", you outsource that burden to government, who steps in and says \"you don\\'t have to worry about micromanaging yourself for the benefit of the community, we\\'ll take care of that for you, but in exchange you have to give us money to do what you should have done on your behalf\".  It further follows that tax breaks for businesses make sense if they reduce the burden on government to manage their impact on the community (since they shouldn\\'t pay someone else to do something they\\'re already doing).  What does and doesn\\'t constitute them taking responsibility for their actions is up for discussion, but that\\'s a different matter.\\n\\nThings like paid sick leave are why this conversation needs to be had.  People being unable to tend to their own health because of work obligations is a community detriment directly caused by the existence of commercial activity.  SOMEONE needs to be responsible for this identifiable and measurable issue, and either that\\'s the businesses or it\\'s the government on their behalf.\\n\\nThis division between explicit and ambiguous detriments is why this conversation is so difficult to have.  You wouldn\\'t tolerate a business that murders children in the community because that\\'s bad, but a business that directly, measurably contributes to reductions in child safety due to pollution and burdens placed on parents is \"complicated\".\\n\\nThe conversation we should be having - the one a lot of talking heads want to steer you away from for vague reasons - is a ground-up community assessment: look at what problems exist in the community, look at the sources causing those problems, and then look at how to address those problems from the perspective that \"everything that happens in the community should benefit the community, and if it doesn\\'t, the things causing the detriment need to remediate the detriment or pay someone else to do so\".\\n\\nPeople unambiguously understand \"if someone murders, they should go to jail as a penalty because murdering hurts the community\", but thanks to decades of subtle messaging guidance, that same logic doesn\\'t apply to \"if someone weighs down the community with malicious business practices, they should be penalized for hurting the community by being forced to undo the hurt they caused\".

Extremely concentrated in the case of the US President.\\n\\nWhenever this happens there is a principal-agent problem. The Will of the People is a sort of myth justifying concentration of power. It doesn’t mean individuals are happy with what their supposed agent is doing and often they are strongly against it.\\n\\nAlso, individual stockholders delegate and concentrate their power in corporations, often indirectly via ETF’s and mutual funds, to the extent that the Will of the Stockholders is a kind of mystical thing. In some cases there are actual stockholders sitting on the board of directors and they can say what they want, but what the mass of stockholders actually want is basically a matter of faith. You can sort of tell by looking at the stock price but this is a noisy signal and it’s a matter of interpretation, like reading tea leaves.\\n\\nIt seems like corporations are a concentration of power, making it *possible* to exercise that power for various purposes, but what they should do with that power is pretty unclear, and most stockholders don’t have any idea. If they diversify then they might not even know the company exists.\\n\\nIt seems like if you want to use your money to exercise power then you should pay someone to do something or donate it to an organization with a clear purpose you believe in. I don’t see buying an index fund as exercising power; it’s a way of abdicating.',\n",

       "              'I\\'m actually pretty confused by this essay, in a way that makes me think I\\'m missing something basic. I\\'ve only seen lefties mention CSR as an on-its-face-ludicrous idea that buying into capitalist ideology will lead you to.\\n\\nThe obvious test case is: a company pollutes a river in a way which they realize will harm many people downstream, but which would be very difficult to detect and trace back to the company. They could prevent this pollution with an expensive mitigation system (which will only decrease profits, even in the long term), or they could let the people downstream be harmed. I think everyone should agree that the company has a clear moral obligation not to knowingly cause this harm. But the plain meaning of the phrase \"The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits\" indicates to me that Friedman disagrees?\\n\\nBy my reading of the essay, it\\'s somehow \"undemocratic\" to ask the factory owner not to pollute, which makes no sense to me. My view is that \"people doing good things is good\": I think excessive pollution / contributions to climate change are bad, so I think it\\'s good when private companies choose to use their own power in a way that mitigates these problems. It\\'s actually somewhat hard for me to see how I *could* be convinced that private companies *shouldn\\'t* voluntarily do more to combat climate change. *All* corporate actions are undemocratic, after all; corporations aren\\'t democratic governments. So that doesn\\'t seem to enter into the equation -- I think they should choose to do good things instead of choosing not doing good things.\\n\\nBut as I said, the whole line of argument leaves me so confused that I\\'m probably missing something. I certainly hope that my characterization of Friedman is a terribly flawed misunderstanding, at least.',\n",

       "              'I wrote my master\\'s thesis on a CSR topic:\\n\\nThere are two questions to answer here. The first is the one that you grapple with, which is essentially the moral question of whether business agents should have the power to utilize shareholder resources to pursue \\'social good\\'. It\\'s an interesting question, to be sure, but is ultimately a disagreement about values; I believe it possible to be morally consistent for the side of \"the business of business is business\" and the side that business needs to act with wider society in mind. I would have to dig through my old references to find scholarly arguments against the Friedman side - of which there are several serious efforts - but for a beginner\\'s book summary, Robert Frank\\'s \"What Price the Moral High Ground?\" is worth seeking out.\\n\\nHowever, the second question you only touch upon: should companies pursue CSR because it aligns with shareholder interest? Now, it has been three years since my thesis was published and I do not actively follow the literature, but at the time the evidence was quite robust that CSR does align with shareholder interest. Companies with CSR commitments outperform those without. And when I say \"outperform\", let me stress that this is not just naive correlations of CSR investment with profit levels or other such statistical handwaving. For example, one of the arguments in favour of organizations pursuing CSR was human resources - the standard of candidate is markedly higher (and a lot more cost efficient than salaries or benefits).',\n",

       "              'It\\'s ironic that in an article on Milton Friedman we get\\n\\n>It feels very strange to me to argue that (1) companies have too much power and influence, therefore (2) we should encourage companies to exercise their influence in ever-widening spheres. \\n\\nWhich I\\'m sure would have given Milton a smile, followed immediately by \\n\\n>If we believe companies have too much power, the right response is to vote in governments to check it, not to mandate that they set their own arbitrary definitions of ‘greater good’ and work towards that.\\n\\nWhen [Friedman\\'s position on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQyJNDY9nEg) was that in practice, companies have too much power [because of government intervention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agdlsgaMzWg). Government intervention\\'s result, despite stated intent, ends up *increasing* corporate power.\\n\\nHis position was [that social responsibility rests with individual people (timestamp)](https://youtu.be/ev_Uph_TLLo?t=173) because institutions  and other inanimate things can\\'t have responsibility, only people can have responsibility. And further that of the problems people face which call out for social responsibility [almost all of them are a result of government action](https://youtu.be/Rls8H6MktrA).\\n\\n>But critics of Friedman who advance this line of argument should be explicit and honest with themselves: they are advocating replacing democracy with technocracy, a system where the resolution of the challenges facing humans are best left to unelected experts.\\n\\nI personally would be much more sympathetic and understanding if people were willing to own up to this. It would be much easier to keep things civil. Unfortunately in most cases people arguing for corporate responsibility either don\\'t understand the implications of their demands, or they are unwilling to acknowledge them.\\n\\n>You can evaluate whether a marketing campaign was successful or not, but it’s much harder to determine whether a brand’s overall positioning is profit-maximising\\n>... I think the founders of such companies are trying to do good; still, one would have to be incredibly naive to not realise that the charitable component of their companies is a point of difference vs incumbents, and appeals to their demographics.\\n\\nThis is IMO the important nuance of the argument. Entrepreneurs often target a niche either because they themselves care about it, or know a lot about it. Often extant companies lack that knowledge and can\\'t target it without coming off as tonedeaf (e.g. [Kendal Jenner\\'s Pepsi ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwvAgDCOdU4)). I often see people arguing that a company could make more profit by not targeting their niche, without recognizing that the people who own and run the company may be targeting that niche because it is where their specific talents and knowledge give them an advantage. \\n\\nMaximizing profit isn\\'t merely about choosing the most profitable segment of a larger market, but about choosing the segment which *you and your employees* specifically are best able to serve competitively. There may frequently be things that would objectively raise profits, but which the specific people involved are unable to think of or unable to execute on for one reason or another. In that case it\\'s rational for them to choose a \"less profitable\" action because it is the most profitable action they specifically can take in practice.',\n",

Personally, I agree. \\n\\nHowever, the problem is more of a cultural issue. I'm not sure exactly what the cause is, but it seems like people would rather provide inefficient help because it makes them feel better. They'd rather force a company to placate them with CSR campaigns than give their own money to a cause, even if it means both them and their cause get less money in the end. They'd rather give a person a sandwich that costs $5 because of bloated administrative costs than just give the person $2 to make the sandwich themselves because of the suspicion that they might decide to spend that $2 on something else.\\n\\nMost people don't want to be efficient or successful.

I think your article makes a couple of interesting points in summary what I got was that, stakeholders capitalism doesn't mean we get unicorns and fairies (the Koch brothers advocating for deregulation was a good example), and that companies can still advocating for progressive causes while increasing profits aligning with shareholders (Toms, Like a girl campaign etc.) .\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI still however remain unconvinced about shareholder capitalism, while I get the theory of shareholder capitalism, I think it is more of the implementation/culture of shareholder capitalisms that people criticize more than the theory. Take for example stock buy backs, despite some companies spending close to their market cap on stock buy backs over the course of a decade the stock won't even grow (IBM, GE, CITI) , never the less  buybacks continue with these companies and not on other types of capitol allocation like M&A, or R&D. I think what people would want, is managers and employees to have more autonomy over how to run their business rather than having to answer to some Hedge Fund manger every quarter about why they haven't given a better stock buyback yet. Yes Friedman is right in that corporations can only focus on profits or free cash flow, and not on some fuzzy concept of social responsibility.  I do think it is the responsibility of the government to align shareholder value with profits though, even Charles Koch would argue that not all profits are good for society. Some examples could be having stock buybacks be taxed like dividends, incentivizing more R&D through tax breaks, and giving managers/other stakeholder more voting rights over corporate governance (perhaps Germany's two tier system could be a good model for this [Aktiengesellschaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft)).\",\n",

This moved the general labor market, which meant that Ford earned a lot more in revenues (because workers at other employers had more money) than he paid out in higher wages. \\n\\nIt made good business sense. It was market manipulation but, unlike all the disgusting downward market manipulation unleashed on the labor market by today\\'s companies, it worked out for good— from labor\\'s point of view.\\n\\nMore than a century later, that action by Ford has been used as the main argument supporting capitalism— that capitalists lose if the workers become poor. It ain\\'t true. For one thing, since the 1980s that problem has been \"solved\" with consumer debt rather than higher wages— companies get revenue out of money the workers don\\'t have and therefore have to rent from the capitalist class. For another, Ford\\'s move only works if one employer is big enough to move the general labor market— and that kind of centralization is undesirable in a capitalist system; in fact, that it is decentralized (unlike state socialism) is capitalism\\'s main justification for its existence.\\n\\nCorporations have implicitly fed us the logic that they won\\'t destroy their host society because, at one anomalous time long ago, a man who was a union-busting antisemitic asshole but could see a business opportunity in raising the wage and forcing other employers to pay better, did so.\\n\\nCapitalists don\\'t need us to thrive. Higher wages increase revenue, but so does more consumer debt. In fact, they\\'d rather suffer than lose relative status— hence, the \"reopening\" that will be catastrophic for everyone but leave them in charge. They will do anything to remain on top.',\n",

There is actually a list (or a few lists) out there of interesting CFPs who do all manner of socially responsible wealth management.

I say that only because going to an independent RIA who specializes in SRI can be a bit expensive and/or you need to have a good amount of investable assets. \\n\\nAvoiding fossil fuels is pretty easy, it is when you get into the nitty gritty of other things where it gets weird. Ie, a lot of big SRI/ESG ETFs and Mutual funds invest in Facebook, Apple, etc. If you want to avoid carbon emissions and do any one other thing around social justice (minority/female board representation, workers rights, etc) the universe of assets you can invest in shrinks really quickly. For example: the GAP low-ish carbon footprint (because they are a store); largely female leadership with a pipeline of other female leaders (some of them even POC!) Double good. Then Boom! Fast casual is one of the biggest users of forced labor camps in China of which the GAP has been implicated.\\n\\n That should not scare you away, just take a minute to figure out where your lines in the sand are; things like no fossil fuel might be a solid one but maybe board diversity doesn't bother you as long as the overall company is doing good work. That way you can communicate those beliefs easily to either your current advisor or a new one.

The chances that you 1) make a bad bet and loose big are pretty good and/or 2) pick a company that looks fine on the surface only to find they somehow affiliate with something or one who is  counter your religious beliefs. \\nThe other thing is that unless you have a LOT of money to invest and live very simply the chances that at 35 you will be able to live off of your investments alone is pretty low. The general rule is if you can live off of roughly 4% of the money you have invested you can likely live off the interest forever. For example if you had £150,000 to invest you could potentially make around £60,000 in interest which after taxes works out to be roughly 40,000 in take home (assuming a steady 4% return a year which cannot be guaranteed). \\nI don't want to throw cold water on your thoughts but it sounds like finding a good financial advisor (perhaps through you mosque or religious connections) who understands your religious needs around wealth would be a good place to start.

My loose, unstructured thoughts below\\n\\n* ESG is a spectrum, as you mentioned. There are generally agreed upon restrictions for ESG investing, such as investing in landmine producing companies - but the lines become quite blurred dependent upon the house view, external agency view and the client view. For example: would you invest in a company that generates 33% of its revenue from increasing education access for minorities or in deprived areas; but the other 66% is made up of revenue from training fighter pilots and corporate media-training? How do you rate this company on a scale? How does the client view this company?\\n* There have been studies on the effectiveness of ESG - namely that higher scores on an ESG scale tend to be stocks that perform well. I largely think that this analysis is driven by the “G” - if you invest in companies with crappy governance, you may experience the stock blowing up due to some unfortunate “G” disaster. Lately, you are seeing excess returns derived from higher “E” as the cost of renewables has decreased over the last decade, a trend which should hopefully continue. The “S” is the hardest, and most blurred - I would say that this type of investing (i.e. having a predefined outcome when you enter) as it doesn’t always increase the price of the stock; adding extra females to the board, hiring more diverse talent, donating profits etc. are all brilliant initiatives that pay off in the long run but do little to move the price over a medium term.\\n* As with clients, I think it is better to ask what you believe in first - this creates an ideal benchmark. Sometimes you want to have an impact, othertimes you want to participate in the turnaround of a company or the transition of an industry on its journey.',\n",

Most of the research I've seen concludes that socially responsible investing results in less diversified portfolios, and (at *absolute best*) similar investment returns, meaning lower risk adjusted returns (you took more risk due to your lower level of diversification).  However, since SRI funds tend to require more active management (security selection and vetting) even for custom SRI index funds, a more likely eventuality is that higher fees result in lower investment returns over time.  This is also assuming that there are no periods in which low SRI stocks outperform and, so long as there is demand for commodities and products such as military hardware, alcohol and cigarettes, this thesis appears extremely unlikely.  [Larry Swedroe, whom I admire greatly, has a succinct piece where he goes over a recent study of the results of SRI funds](http://mutualfunds.com/news/2016/02/09/does-ethical-based-investing-impact-returns/), which effectively demonstrates that investors in those funds may receive a behavioural social benefit (the good feeling they get when they know that they are investing 'responsibly') but at a cost of lower investment returns.  Perhaps this is because sin companies are priced more like value stocks, while socially responsible darlings are bid up by investors seeking social benefits rather than economic ones?\\n\\nIn principle, if you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, SRI can never have any impact on the capital market.  At some point, even if it did influence the price of securities, the most it could do would be to effect a transfer of risk-free return between active market participants (with the socially responsible investor being the loser in this arrangement).\\n\\nGenerally, the prevailing wisdom is to ignore investment buzzwords and fads.  Invest in simple, timeless products like cap weighted, total market index funds (warts and all).  If you are concerned with social, economic or environmental issues affecting our planet and society (and you should be; empathy for others is an admirable human characteristic), your cause is likely to be best served by donating a portion of your investment profits to the registered charity of your choice, rather than giving it to fund companies in fees or hedge fund managers in excess returns.\",\n",

This Core Fund will complement our new Climate Fund and existing Opportunity Fund. This will be USV’s seventh early-stage venture fund since the firm was founded in 2003. \\n\\nAs before, we continue to invest with a thesis-driven approach, the USV Thesis 3.0: \\n\\nTrusted brands that broaden access to knowledge, capital, and well-being by leveraging networks, platforms, and protocols\\n\\nWe believe this thesis is as relevant today as when we articulated it in April 2018.\\n\\nThis past year has seen fundamental (and likely permanent) behavioral changes such as the growth in distance learning, increased usage of telemedicine and asynchronous digital health delivery, and the rise of remote work. These changes accelerated digitalization of tech stacks that in other industries have often been a precursor to falling costs and wider access (e.g., ecommerce). These are the types of opportunities we have been focused on since the beginning of Thesis 3.0. \\n\\nWe are particularly interested in understanding companies that are finding ways to broaden access to learning and healthcare by creating new, trusted solutions. For example, education is largely taught the same way today as it has been historically – a physical arena where people join for classes. Medical care as well –  big changes in 2020 notwithstanding. What are the ways to make people – learners and patients – the center of these markets? We aim to find not only the direct application of these solutions, but also those that serve the solutions.\\n\\nCompanies we’ve invested in like Duolingo, Outschool, Quizlet, Codecademy, Sora Schools and Skillshare broaden access to knowledge; Nurx, Brave Health, and Modern Fertility broaden access to wellbeing. These are good guideposts which we will continue to focus on: either direct to learner/patient or an enabling layer to fuel the direct to learner/patient market. We also look to expand the definition of what this means – for example, we are particularly interested in mental health companies that may not look like healthcare businesses at all.\\n\\nAccess to knowledge means education but also tools and platforms that support how knowledge is shared and remembered in organizations or groups, including in this new, more remote world.\\n\\nWellbeing to us includes healthcare but also community and fun. New delivery mediums (such as audio) present ways to bring high-density kinds of information to more people for entertainment, healthcare, learning or other purposes. This includes companies like Abridge, Headgum, Wattpad and Meet Cute. Here we also look for new tools and technology-enabled production methodologies.\\n\\nSimilarly, access to capital remains concentrated. Companies like Possible, Stash, Teamshares and Noah broaden services to more people, on better terms through innovations in business models, underlying infrastructure, or new ways of reaching the customer. We also continue to look for ideas that center on collaborative solutions to capital problems – multiplayer fintech, if you will. \\n\\nAs in our last several funds, we expect a significant portion of the investments -around 30%- will be crypto-related investments. This will include holding tokens directly as well as equity in early-stage blockchain-related projects. Crypto networks embody both the evolution of trust in computing and financial systems, as well as vastly expanded access, so we view crypto networks as completely aligned with Thesis 3.0. We believe the opportunity to decentralize systems is still in early stages, seeing adoption tailwinds, and with a lot of interesting new activity.\\n\\nAs always, we remain committed to our way of practicing venture capital and finding those companies that believe we can be great partners. Our funds are small. Our focus is thesis-driven. Our website is a compilation of ideas from ourselves and others, constantly evolving yet always open and public. We publish our investment memos as blog posts. We are active partners to all the companies we invest in at all times. And our decision making is collaborative (we don’t vote).\\xa0\\n\\nThank you to our investors for their continued trust.',\n",

I would add for any skeptic on the bull uranium thesis, the lead time to building a mine can range, from the DFS to actual first ore mined, between 2 years to 6 years depending on factors such as open-pit versus underground, infrastructure access, ISR versus traditional mining. Even if we assume all mine restart now, the ones in care and maintenance, and even add BHP's Olympic dam expansion, we will arrive in 2028, the year at which cigar lake will end production, with a massive deficit in supply. To put it another way, we would have needed mines to start building new advanced stage deposits in the last 2 years in order to satisfy what looks like, in the most likely scenario, a real deficit of roughly 20 to 30 M lbs a year by 2024. Every year that goes by where projects that could start are being delayed, we further stretch the elastic in the direction of a quick rise in sport and term market price. Whilst this news might be disappointing for short-term traders in the space, rest assured that every year that goes by without seeing a rise in market price and long-term contracting activity increases the length and the depth of the rally that will see in the future.\",\n",

I take the point that it wouldn’t wholly fill the supply gap over the next decade, but we’re talking about this bull run as a relatively short term entity.

In numbers is strength. The problem is people need the exit eventually - dividends or sale. The first won’t happen in many of these, the second requires you exit before others do if there isn’t an institutional bid to take it. Look at what happened with marijuana stocks a couple years ago to see what happens when fast retail money is the investor base. Losses over 90% in some cases. \\n\\nA good number of the stocks you went into are really flawed companies that either won’t exist or will have far lower valuations in 5 years. Some are very good and well timed companies - fb and arguably Tesla (valuation) as well as disney. But many of your picks would’ve been a disaster in any other matket - this one is really unique, unlike anything that’s been seen since the late 90s and late 20s, which were the last times fast retail or retail-like money dominated.  \\n\\nJinko solar as an example had a good break but has no advantages, and is a commodity producer. It also might get delisted in a year or two because of new us rules. Solar in general is a horrible industry because it’s commodity and because China created oversupply with national industrial policy eliminating the benefit of producing more efficiently - since they’ll dump product at or below cost in some cases. I know less about first solar but pretty sure most of the value is in install which is a local contractor business. Just because something is good for society doesn’t mean the industry will be profitable. Solar hasn’t been. \\n\\nWind is just a narrow not great business. Specific wind companies may be but most of our future green energy is going to be solar, or fusion if we crack that. \\n\\nWKHS has a head start but lacks tech advantages. Tesla is the only credible ev company, so all of the possible ev companies get a huge bid. But most are bad companies that will get out competed by either Tesla or an existing large, well run auto company like Toyota or Ford. \\n\\nRare earths are also a horrible business. It’s a global commodity. China over supplies it under national industrial policy and to get some control so everyone is now building out capacity for national strategic reasons then government will make purchases to make it survive. But you’ll have a massively oversupplied commodity market which means zero or negative profits. Only up because of the retail bid. \\n\\nCommon theme of a lot of your smaller green stocks is you bought stuff for which there will be revenue and a future need, but industry dynamics with the company’s strategy prevent strong profitability. \\n\\nSome of your best purchases you got pretty late and show very small returns. SHOP is up 1500% for a lot of people. Chasing a gain on a stock up 1500% in the past year can work but is aggressive. \\n\\nAnyway congrats on the gains but you need to not view these as your investing rules. This year is unlike any other and a lot of your positions stand on greater fools not selling. I would be particularly wary of any company that has been $1b of market cap or less in past 2 years and is up 5x or more in the past year, especially if it is a chinese adr or is a former penny stock. Id also be skeptical of industries that lack profitability. A lot of yours are checking most of those boxes.\\n\\nYou said it yourself, this works because you are buying your beliefs. A lot of new retail money is doing that and that makes this profitable now - if everyone buys it goes up. But investing works in the long run because the companies make a lot of money and/or persistently attract capital from major allocators. Many on this list will do neither.',\n",

I think you've made some good picks (except Shopify, don't even get me started on that hot piece of garbage) and have a good mindset about everything. \\n\\nPlease please please please please keep in mind that your performance so far isn't because you have made great picks necessarily. You got lucky on timing and so did I. Don't get too confident. Don't think you know everything. I invested at the beginning of the crash and made very different picks from you, but I too have made a ton of money. \\n\\nStay humble. Keep buying. Focus on school not stocks. Educating yourself and creating a stream of income is much more important at this stage in your life. A solid income will allow you to buy more stocks. With some extremely rare exceptions, people who spend their time creating streams of income or improving their primary stream (job/business) and buy more stocks will come out ahead of people who spend all their time trying to pick the perfect stocks. This is not common knowledge (do some reading and reflecting), but not even Warren Buffet made his money by picking the right stocks.\\n\\nAll this being said, take my advice with a grain of salt. I'm only 23 and still have a fuck ton more to learn about the world, but I have been at this just a little longer and (simply because we are at such a developmental stage in our lives) have had many more life experiences than you. \\n\\nOnce again, stay humble. This is the single greatest mindset to adopt in my experience. Always stay humble.\",\n",

If you’re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there.\\n\\nCongratulations on your results, and on your willingness to share your though process. My main concern is with your idea that \"traditional metrics\" are irrelevant for Tesla. Presumably you are talking about value metrics such as PE and PEG , book value, and such which can be used as a means of finding the intrinsic value of the company. \\n\\nIt\\'s true that it\\'s very hard to value a company during hyper-growth, so those metrics become somewhat meaningless because you don\\'t know what the real P/E is if you don\\'t know what the earnings are actually going to be in the future.\\n\\nWhen you buy a business for long term hold (as opposed to short term speculation that someone else will pay more for it than you paid), the \"traditional metrics\" are the only thing you would care about, because that\\'s how you can judge whether you will make back enough money to make it worth your investment. How much would you pay for, say, a local plumbing company or gas stations that earns $250,000 per year? Would 1,000x earnings be reasonable? If so, I will happily sell you such a business for $250M bucks. That\\'s what you\\'re paying for TSLA today, on hopes that they will make LOTS more than they do today.\\n\\nBut one thing is for sure, unless TSLA in the near future earns many multiples of what it earns now, the price is going to get crushed. If the hyper-growth slows down the price will be hammered. It won\\'t be a \"dip\" or a \"correction\", it will be a permanent loss of capital for TSLA speculators. \\n\\nFor you it will be no big deal, since you are not gambling your rent money. But when this bubble pops, a lot of people who have speculated way too much money that they should not be putting at risk, will get crushed. \\n\\nBeing a long term holder won\\'t save you. In order for the value of the company to match the current prices and recover, will take decades of successful business growth. AMZN peaked at ~$86 in Dec \\'99 and didn\\'t see those levels again until 2009. And AMZN is the most successful of the post- Dotcom bubble companies.',\n",

Good on ya mate. \\n\\nOn the topic of future energy trends, I would like to humbly add 3 points to it.\\n\\n1) Oil I believe is a sunset industry, though even then, not in the next 5 years as the vehicles and infra around it are not ready to transition out. Further, oil is a major revenue generator for petronas, so, doubt the country will be willing to accelerate killing the golden goose just yet until petronas is able to transition themselves to different sources of revenue.\\n\\nHowever, gas is an energy source that will blossom in the next 5 to 20 years. Its considered a 'cleaner' source of energy compared to other carbon based and there is an abundance of cheap supply. Hence you see capital investments in gas ramping up past few years including from petronas.\\n \\nRenewable sources will continue to grow tremendously, but if you look at the sheer scale of energy needs and how much proportion is renewables, it will take a long long while more before energy hungry nations can shutter their dependence on carbon based sources.\\n\\n2) So if we talk about the future sources of energy and future trends in mobility, agree with your assessment of where battery tech is evolving. Hydrogen is also a trend that is accelerating albeit very much still in the development stage.\\n\\nWhat does it mean for investors? Besides the obvious names like Tesla and Panasonic etc, consider the less obvious names like the chinese EV carmakers as they are accelerating EV development too. \\n\\nAlso consider the wider supply chain ecosystem for investment ideas. What are the non-sexy supporting industries? For EVs, highly dependent on semiconductors. Hence continued boom for semicon counters? Also, who is leading the charging station push. Will we see the end of a petrol station as we know it? For batteries, what raw materials are required? Even for utility players and power gen players, will we see unprecedented demand growth since more and more sectors transition to electricity as their power source? Lots of opportunities out there i reckon 😁\\n\\nP.s RIP to your dog. And thank you for the timely reminder of whats important in life, money making is just a means to an end\",\n",

Volumes for futures and options contracts have more than doubled since 2015, ICE said in a statement Monday. The trades will continue to be cleared through ICE’s London business.\\n> \\n> The shift comes after the Brexit transition period ended on Dec. 31, cutting off access to most London trading from the bloc and jolting several major markets. European equities have moved to Amsterdam and Paris from London, while some derivatives contracts have shifted out of Europe altogether in favor of Wall Street platforms.\\n> \\n> The development is a setback for the U.K.’s government’s bid to become a center for sustainable finance. In his vision for financial services after Brexit, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has said he wants the U.K. to be a “world leader in the use of green finance,” and that Britain is preparing to issue its first green gilts.\\n> \\n> Read more on the U.K.’s plans for green finance\\n> \\n> At issue for the carbon market is the lack of an “equivalence” decisions from the EU that would have made it cheaper and easier for traders to continue dealing in London. Lobby groups for energy firms pressed Brussels at the end of last year to take urgent action to resolve the matter, arguing they would face a “stark choice” of paying more in collateral to do business in London or else restrict their ability to manage risks.\\n> \\n> While EU and U.K. policy makers are discussing how to cooperate on financial services going forward, Brussels has signaled it’s in no rush to grant broad access to London through equivalence decisions. The realities of leaving the EU have “come home to roost” for Britain, Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial services commissioner, said on Bloomberg TV last month.\\n> \\n> The U.K. is launching its own emissions trading system to cover polluters now that it’s out of the EU. Nominally launched at the beginning of this year, ICE is set to begin auctions by the second quarter, along with the trading of futures contracts.\\n> \\n> There is an expectation in the market that the U.K. and EU could link the two systems so that permits in one could be used in the other, boosting liquidity.',\n",

I'm happy to talk, if you'd like.\\n\\nAs far as what I did, it was mostly Google like crazy and cry, tbh. I also found TFMR online groups on Baby Center and WTE, and it was very helpful (albeit heartbreaking) to hear others' stories. I totally understand you wanting it all to just be over, I was the same. We had a (very) abnormal NT scan at 12 weeks, followed by a NIPT and CVS at the MFM (their scan confirmed that the NT/cystic hygroma was very large and getting worse). For us, having each test come back with consistent results helped, in a way. It was the hardest decision we've ever had to make, but being certain about the diagnosis made us feel more sure in our decision to terminate at almost 16 weeks.\\n\\nCould you call the department that will do the termination and start to set up an appointment? It can always be cancelled or moved based on your results, but at least then you'd know. I had to go to a totally different practice for it, but the nurse was unbelievably patient and compassionate (I definitely ugly-cried on the phone every time I spoke to her). They can also tell you any changes or restrictions that may occur due to timing and answer questions. Don't feel guilty for considering a TFMR before your results come in. The reality is that there's a time sensitivity and medical offices are busy. Like I said, setting an appointment is not definitive, it can always be cancelled.\",\n",

It sounds from your other posts that you are in America. I'm in Britain so things may be different. Out 12 week scan showed increased nucal thickening which led to the blood test same as you with 85% result. I then had the CVS a two weeks after that result as they wanted the baby to grow a bit more. We absolutely had to be sure before making any decisions about TFMR and my doctor in the fetal medical unit described the CVS as the 'gold standard' test. We saw it as an essential factor in helping us make a decision. I will be honest that it was an unpleasant procedure and I found it emotionally very traumatic but also very necessary. The CVS was Friday and we had the results by the following Wednesday. I was then back in the next Wednesday for the TFMR. I'm not sure how they do it in the States, but at my local women's hospital you are induced and give birth to the baby so do find out what the procedure would be like if you choose to go down that route. I was 16weeks+1day when we lost our boy. I coped in those 4 weeks of worry by working. I had to carry on and I refused to Google - which I see lots have people have said they did. I didn't want false hope and I also didn't want no hope. I stayed busy. Cried a lot and didn't do a lot to sleeping. I know due to Covid you might not be able to do that. But above all else, talk. Do not hold it in. We lost our boy on the 4th December and I was due this coming 18th May. I am still working through it and it hasn't been easy.

If we had known ahead of time, I would have strongly wanted to consider aborting, and I probably would have been in favor of it. My wife absolutely would not have done it, though, so it\\'s a moot question.\\n\\nEleven years later, I can tell you that there\\'s no way I\\'d give up my daughter, I don\\'t wish that we hadn\\'t had her, nothing like that. She\\'s awesome, and I love having her. But my love for and attachment to her is completely post-birth -- she\\'s now a living, breathing, person to me, so I can no longer imagine my world without her.\\n\\nHowever, if I didn\\'t know her, was back 12 years ago and told that the baby is going to have Down? Yep, I\\'d still strongly consider aborting.\\n\\nThat\\'s the background and context. Here\\'s my advice:\\n\\nFirst, it\\'s a decision for you and your wife.  Anyone who tells you that they know the \"right\" answer, whether it\\'s by religion, experience, knowledge of society, whatever -- they\\'re wrong. The decision belongs to you two.\\n\\nSecond, a negative: you\\'re going to hear plenty of people talk about how \"Down Syndrome made our lives better. We\\'re so blessed with this gift. Blah blah blah.\" I\\'m happy that those people feel that way. If that\\'s part of their paradigm, great. It doesn\\'t work for me. IMO, it\\'s not a fucking gift. My daughter is great. The Down Syndrome sucks. It brings health threats, stress that you don\\'t have with non-DS kids, bullying from the shitty people in society, and more. Having a child with Down Syndrome is NOT just like having any other child, no matter how people like to dismiss it as such.\\n\\nThird, a positive: IMO, there is still a lot of truth to the \"every child is different anyway\" philosophy, and the differences that come with Down Syndrome sometimes do actually cause positives. In my case, I\\'ve become far more patient with (most) people, because I\\'ve had to learn to be so much more patient with my daughter. I\\'m also convinced that having a special needs child facilitates us meeting some of the best people in the world, whom we might not have encountered otherwise.\\n\\nSome things to expect: you can expect to have as many positive and happy moments as you would have with any other child -- expect to closely examine and possibly adjust your expectations to make sure you don\\'t miss these. Expect to plan, and most likely to stress a bit or a lot; you\\'ll need to figure out how your child will be cared for when you\\'re no longer capable of providing care. Expect to learn a lot about working with schools and other organizations who might need to accommodate your child\\'s needs -- some of these will embrace your situation, others will be outright antagonistic, and you\\'ll have to figure out how to navigate them. Expect additional stress between you and your wife when Down brings you a truly trying moment, and plan ahead for how you two will cope together when it happens. There\\'s a reason the divorce rate of parents in the special needs community is so much higher than in the rest of society. \\n\\nI know it sounds like I\\'m calling out all the negatives, but face it -- most of the differences brought by DS are negatives. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t handle them in a happy, healthy, positive way. It just means that DS brings you a high chance of heart perforations and mental retardation; it never brings you super immunity and an invitation from MENSA. The key, IMO, is to be sure that you can make a happy family life with the successes your child will have -- life will still be wonderful, it\\'ll just likely be a wonderful different from what you pictured when you thought about having a child.',\n",

I felt so much shame for considering termination, but at the same time, I knew there was no way to bring my child into the world unless my wife and I were fully on board.  We spent several nights just crying on the couch together.  Even without making a decision, we were in mourning, because we had lost the child that we were expecting to bring into this world. We stopped telling people about the pregnancy, because if we decided to terminate, we didn't want our friends to know about it.  \\n\\nA few weeks passed, and the day came where the doctor asked us if we wanted to get an amniocentesis to confirm the diagnosis.  An amnio, as you will find out, has very high accuracy but also a very small chance of causing a miscarriage.  We decided that we didn't need confirmation, because we were going to keep the baby no matter what.  Looking back, I think that is when the healing truly started to begin.  By the time our daughter was born, we were not only ready, we were excited. \\n\\nThere is no easy path to get to this decision, and nobody--not me, or your family, or anyone else--can tell you what decision to make.  Take your time.  Allow your hearts and minds to slow down a little.  Nothing but time will heal the hurt that you are feeling right now.  You are mourning, and mourning has to run its course.  Either you are mourning the loss of another child, or you are mourning that your child won't have the life that you dreamed for him or her.   \\n\\nBut that said, once the mourning has run its course, there is joy on the other end like you could never imagine.

She is without a doubt the best thing to ever happen to me, and the light of my life.  She has so much joy, and even though she takes longer than her peers to do certain things, she loves life to the fullest and enriches those around her.\\n\\nDon't do it right away, as it will be too much to process, but in the coming weeks, find a down syndrome support group in your area and connect with other families.

Down syndrome is pretty mild compared to some of the other diagnosis out there.  But it does still come with additional and specific hardships and trials.  I have seen several parents who because they accepted something they couldn’t handle, have destroyed their lives and lead to their disabled child being forced to live a life of abuse and neglect.  Not being able to handle a disabled child does not make you a bad person.  But accepting one and then not meeting their needs and the responsibilities you accepted, does.\\n\\nBefore my daughter, the idea of being a parent to a disabled child wasn’t ever something I thought I wanted.  I had no real interactions with those with either physical or mental disabilities, except for a few instances.  I did t believe I was capable of it.  So when my daughter was born and we learned of her diagnosis, i was shattered.  I was so scared.  I felt so inadequate.  I felt so guilty of wanting my daughter to be something she wasn’t.  I mourned the daughter I thought I was having.  I was so overwhelmed by what I didn’t know, by what I thought my life would be like.  It was like my life stopped, and now all of a sudden I was living a life I never planned on or wanted. \\n\\nWhat I wish I could show you now, what I wish I had know when I was going through what you are, is how normal my life is.  How normal my daughters life is.  Yes, there are more doctors visits, and specialists.  There are different teachers, and different milestones met in different ways.  But so much of our everyday life is exactly the same as everyone else’s.  My daughter does have DS, but it’s such a small part of who she is.  She is still the little girl I carried and wanted.  She is exactly who she was supposed to be.  She just had a surprise we didn’t know about.  I truly love my daughter.  Not in spite of her DS, but because of who she is, because of everything she is.  She is smart, and cute, and funny, and sweet.  She loves her older sister and her cats.  She loves to help cook, and to color, and read.  She loves dancing and singing.  She loves playing with her baby dolls.  She fights with me and her sister, just like other kids.  She will refuse to wear pants, just like other kids.  She will sneak into the hidden candy stash and try and get out of being in trouble, just like other kids.  She goes to school. She has friends.  She goes swimming. She loves play grounds and museums.  \\n\\nWhile I don’t think being a parent to a disabled child is for everyone, I also don’t think that it’s something only special people can do.  I’m not really any different than other parents.  I’m not specially gifted for the difficulties that my daughter brings with her.  I’m constantly learning and messing up, just like every other parent in the world.  But there are things that I do believe I would never have learned or gained because of my daughter.  The person I am today, is someone I am very proud to be.  And I owe a lot of that to my daughter.\\n\\nI’m so sorry for what you are going through.  I wish there was something I could say that made this easier for you.  But what I want you to know, is that there isn’t a wrong decision.  Just the right decision for you and your family.  And if that decision is keeping the pregnancy, you will have a whole community of people in real life and on line who will be there to support you.  ',\n",

I thought no matter what it’s my child I would deal with the challenges. My partner didn’t want the baby as he thought he would be unable to cope. We spoke about it and decided that we would give it a go.  I cried for a bout two weeks straight until I finally thought it’s my baby this should be the happiest moment of my life. People avoided the subject as they didn’t know how to approach it and I kind of thought to myself maybe they got it wrong. But at birth he was taken away as he wasn’t breathing properly and I wasn’t able to see him for a few hours. And that not knowing told me o would love him no matter what. He was diagnosed when he was a day old. Fortunately he has no sight, hearing or heart problems. I thought my family and friends wouldn’t accept him as he was disabled and boy was I wrong the amount of love shown to him is overwhelming. It has been a struggle but if I could go back and change it for myself I would not. He is amazing. It’s ok to feel like your unlucky in this situation, it’s normal to want everything to be perfect.

I don't say this to be rude. I know and understand why a lot of people would find this to be a hard decision. Still, I think it's important to explain that it would be a very easy decision for many people. Hard decisions are where the choices seems to have pros and cons that balance each other and are difficult to weigh: vanilla vs. chocolate would be a harder decision for many people.  \\n\\n\\nImagine that you think  without a religious viewpoint (e.g. thinking that a child is a gift from God). Now, imagine that birth control failed and you had to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy. If you were going to postpone having a child for another year or two, it might be a difficult decision: maybe we should have this one. But, if you were absolutely certain that you did not want a child, the decision is a simple one: have an abortion.   \\n\\n\\nYou need to ask yourself the most important question: why are we having a child? You made a decision to have a child...why? In essence, children are great values to us parent... they bring so much joy in so many ways. One of the ways in which they do this is that we get to help them grow up, we get a chance to give them our values, and see them grow into certain types of adults. If this is part of your motivation, then there is a point at which a kid with significant living disabilities is not going to fulfill your core reasons for having a child in the first place.   \\nThese days, there is so much technology and other support, so one can fulfill one's reasons even if one has a kid with disabilities that would have been debilitating a generation ago: but there's a limit.  \\n\\n\\nOf course if you have a kid and they meet with some catastrophe, you will do all you can to support them. But, this is not a living, breathing person yet. Really, only a religious or similarly mystical view can equate a baby at 20 or so weeks with a  full human person.   \\n\\n\\nAnother important aspect about having kids is that they come with a cost: all kids do. Nobody can ever prepare you enough for how much your life changes when you have kids. So much of your world starts to revolve around their needs, goals, schedules. This is increasingly true as families are smaller and neighbors are more distant. When you decide to have a kid, you with the values against these costs. With a kid who has significant disabilities, these costs (not talking money... mostly, mental focus, and also time)... go up. At some point, they bog you down.  \\n\\n\\nCan you get through it? Sure, so many people do? if you have the kid, will you love it and be happy that you had it, and tremble at the thought that you contemplated abortion: almost certainly...once you have a living, breathing -- most importantly, interacting -- human child, you will be a great parent and enjoy your parenting.  \\n\\n\\nBut, you would lie to yourself if you thought these were the costs and benefits that you signed up for when you decided to have a kid. Sometimes nature messes up. It's part of life, but you don't have to resign yourself to it anymore than you would resign yourself to some other tragedy for which you have an easy solution.\",\n",

We did a ton of research and talked to everyone we could (doctors, staff from Down Syndrome clinics, etc.). \\n\\nWe knew that we could have made it work but when we looked at other families and found one that could do it better we made our choice so that he would have the best chance at a good life.

Can you afford the possibility of putting your child in a facility if he/she needs care you can’t give? Can you handle possibly outliving your child? Can you handle giving up your retirement to care for a disabled, adult child? Potentially working for many more years to make ends meet for everyone? If you have other children what does this mean for them, their time with you and their financial stability? Can your marriage withstand it? Can you handle this alone if your wife were to die for some reason? Can she handle it if you died? These are worst case scenarios but you should prepare for all possibilities. And if you both can handle it no matter what then that’s awesome. But there’s absolutely no shame in saying you can’t and choosing a termination. You can also choose adoption, but going back to your normal life after will be hard. People will know your wife was pregnant and wonder what happened. You most likely will be judged by some. Depending on your state her family or yours could make things difficult. That child will be out there in the world and could find you someday. That’s a hard option too.\\n\\nThis is a terrible decision to have to make. You’re in my thoughts. \\n\\n',\n",

Our lab tests each specimen and if there's a positive they contact the donor to determine if a prescription medication was what caused it.  i.e.  If you're on a medication for depression it might show up as a false positive for  methamphetamine use.  If you're on a prescription medication the lab should never give that information to your employer and the results of your drug test should show negative.  \\n\\nIf we're talking about medical marijuana it can get a bit complicated.  Even if North Carolina allows medical marijuana, remember it's only quasi-legal as federal law still prohibits its use.  And many states have provisions allowing employers to disqualify candidates in sensitive positions for positive THC results even if they have a doctor's permission to take it.  I say doctor's permission because in some states (like Arkansas) you cannot get a prescription for marijuana though you can get a doctor's note to take it.  \\n\\nAs others have said, you probably want to contact counsel.  If this is related to marijuana you might be able to find someone to work pro bono as this is an murky area of law that still needs to be hammered out.\",\n",

I received another patients positive results and they received my clean screen. (IN)**\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal Post: \\r\\n\\r\\n> Yesterday, when I went to the clinic to get my dose, I was told there was a hold on my account and needed to see my counselor. Apparently, my DT from last week came back positive for opiate & fentanyl. This is 100% impossible and my counselor said there’s a new lab tech, and that it’s possible they switched my label with someone elses. He also said this wouldn’t be the first time Its happened.\\n> He even had a patient in mind that it could have been switched with, because we tested around the same time and their screen came back negative while he was expecting it to be positive. \\n> He told me I can pay $40 to have the sample investigated further, to see exactly what percent and substance was in the urine; but I informed him I didn’t want to pay that for someone else’s results. If I were to do that, I would have a new test done and also pay to have that sample reviewed, to cross reference both results. \\n> I also asked if he could cross reference the results of everyone who took a test the same time as me, and he told me he would do that, as well as speak to his supervisor about how to go about fixing this. He does believe the results were wrong, and seems to be working on my side, but he’s also being slightly nonchalant about it. Where as I’m freaking out, this is a huge mistake for someone to make, and I do not want my record to reflect someone else’s results. \\n> After meeting with my counselor yesterday he put me down for another drug test that day, which I went to do but was informed the lady left early, I then told my counselor this and he said I could take it this morning. But I received an email from him earlier, starting supervisors would not be in today due to bad weather, and they are only doing dosing today, meaning I can’t do the drug test today either. \\n> I’m not sure how to go about this situation, I feel my hands are tied but I’m extremely upset and feel they should be taking this a bit more seriously than they are. \\n> Any advice would be much appreciated and I’ll answer any questions about what I may have left out. \\n> \\n> Also, my counselor does believe these aren’t my results, because I even quit smoking marijuana almost 2 weeks ago and have had no illicit substances(aside from thc) in any previous drug screens. I’ve kept my counselors informed about what’s going on with me and work with them, I’m very dedicated to my sobriety. \\n> \\n> I asked him if the positive screen had thc in it as well, thinking that would be a dead giveaway if it didn’t, but unfortunately it did. That is why I made the comment about paying for both the old and new screen to be reviewed further, to check the amount of thc in each to see if it could prove it’s not mine, since my level would have been extremely low on last weeks result, and more than likely non-existent in this new test (that I will hopefully take tomorrow)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\nLocationBot 4.999988713 83/601rds  | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) | >!TdUO5NmMWlXWXJFcjJzZ!<',\n",

The fact that your second test is fully negative is reassuring. The only way for you to be positive is to either be one of those rare infection cases on prep or acute infection of hiv1 or very early infection of hiv 2.

At this point I was convinced she had Mosaic Turner. They didn't think a fetal echo was necessary after a very long and detailed look at the heart twice at my MFM. At birth they sent the blood to the Mayo Clinic for a targeted FISH, the results came back in about a week that she was normal XX.

Solar can only be produced during the day and depends on the weather.  Wind is fairly consistent, but still somewhat weather-dependant and storms and high winds can force turbines to park to avoid damage, cutting power.  Hydro is consistent, but the locations hydro can be built are limited.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve heard a lot of people say that Nuclear is going to replace coal as the stable, consistent energy supplier with reliability other renewables can\\'t reach.\\n\\nOnly problem I have with this idea is that nuclear fuel is expensive.  With coal, if demand is low because of cheap renewables they can just burn less coal and save on costs.  But nuclear fuel is kind of *always* \"burning\".  Even when the control rods are inserted to reduce power, the fuel rods are being expended at the same rate.  Meaning nuclear becomes *super* expensive to run if it has to compete with cheaper renewables.\\n\\nThoughts?',\n",

However, I'm trying to do a bit of my own DD as well and have a question for you. How does the lifetime of nuclear reactors factor into the bull thesis? I've read that most reactors have an expected lifespan of around 40 years and with many having been built in the 80s-90s, this means they are coming up to the end of their life cycles and may go offline. On the flip side, I've also read that the 40 years is a conservative estimate and many of those may stay online well beyond the expected 40 year lifespan.

The uranium sector recently got on my radar but after some preliminary research, I have a few doubts and would like to hear your opinions about them.\\n\\n1) Considering uranium is of national security interest to many countries, how would you play the uranium sector to take advantage of the increase in demand from both China and the US? The new bill passed by the Biden administration clearly states that \"*Uranium from companies owned, controlled, or subject to jurisdictions in Russia or China are excluded from participating in the program.\"* Therefore, is it safe for me to assume that I can only tap on either of the superpowers to drive the increase in demand for uranium for the company that I am interested in? Also, would I have to incur huge political risks by investing in uranium?\\n\\n2) Although nuclear power plants are increasingly becoming safer, the public is still ambivalent towards the building of nuclear plants. Do you think that given the choice, governments would rather invest in more politically-popular renewable energy sources (such as solar and wind) compared to nuclear energy?

Most information is taken from China\\'s Hydrogen/Fuel Cell White Paper (v2019), Japan\\'s Hydrogen Roadmap (Oct 2020), and Europe\\'s Hydrogen Roadmap (Feb 2019).\\n\\n**Safety standards & Infrastructure**\\n\\nLots of research and testing have been done to ensure safety of Hydrogen energy & fuel cell. >10 countries have H2 transportation & refuel station standards in place.\\n\\nJapan, Germany and US are leading in #of H2 refueling station installations (113/81/64) at end of 2019. China recognizes its position in the use of this important medium of energy and plans to catch up by end of 2020 to be second country to have >100 H2 refueling stations (for fuel cell cars).\\n\\nJapan leads the pack in 1) H2 and Fuel Cell research 2)Vehicles produced (mostly Toyota Mirai) 3) H2 Use Cases including world\\'s first Co-Gen Turbine (capable of gas/H2 mixtures) at 100% H2 since April 2018, supplying heat to hospital and \\\\~1.1 MW electricity to exhibition hall at Kobe Port Island\\n\\n[**Technology Breakthrough**](https://h2-industries.com/en/lohc-technology-overview/)\\n\\nH2 can be transported in gas, liquified, or solid forms. Commercially gas form is the most popular currently. A Liquified Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) technology was among the finalists of the prestigious Deutscher Zukunftspreis 2018 (President\\'s Prize). It uses an oil-like liquid to chemically bind hydrogen(57kg of H2 per 1m3 of liquid). The end product liquid can be stored and transported using existing pas storage/pipelines. It makes storage and transportation of hydrogen quite a lot safer (and cheaper) than using pressurized containers to store and transport H2 gas. In order to release the H2, the liquid is passed through catalyst. The cycle is closed - the oil-like liquid is very well-understood and could be reused many, many times. It is 1/50th of cost of lithium-ion batteries.\\n\\n**Role of Hydrogen Energy**\\n\\nMain use cases for fuel cells are for trucks/long hauls/buses/stationary electricity generation. Therefore, fuel cell is not a direct competitor of EV in the consumer market. In fact, Maximizing H2 use is critical in closing Carbon Emissions gap to reach the 2 Degree Scenario (2DS). EU\\'s Hydrogen Roadmap points out seasonal energy needs (e.g. heating in winter in north of EU) cannot be satisfied by increase of power generation - there will always be excess capacity. H2 is the best option to store that excess energy. \\n\\n**InPower-LOOP Partnership**\\n\\nInPower-LOOP joint venture setup its Nanjing office in Jan 2020. By April, it had won the contract with Nanjing City Bus (\\\\~100 range extenders at \\\\~$15 mln US$ for 3 years) with 7000 buses in the fleet to replace/refurbish, By August the production/R&D facility is completed. In my opinion LOOP is quite smart to get a foot in this market where the Chinese is heavily investing in order to catch up to (and surpass) Japan/Germany/US in the area of H2/Fuel Cell. It is quite clear that there are lots of opportunities.\\n\\nChina could also be a tricky market to compete in. That’s where the risks and rewards are. Being there to compete is an important step forward.\\n\\n===========Some noteworthy events ==========\\n\\n2017\\n\\n19th Communist Party National Summit. \"build clean, low-carbon, safe & efficient modern energy eco system, promote ecological investments\". In September China Hydrogen Alliance h2cn.org was formed with participation from top universities, 19 major heavy industry players, financial institutions.\\n\\n2019\\n\\nHydrogen energy first mentioned in Government of China annual report. \"to promote electrical charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure...\" First edition of [China Hydrogen Energy & Fuel Cell White Paper](http://www.h2cn.org/Uploads/File/2019/07/25/u5d396adeac15e.pdf) published.\\n\\n2020\\n\\nUntil end of June, 70 hydrogen refueling stations were built. Estimate by year end, and China will be the second country with over 100 H2 refill stations (Japan being first place, 113 at end of 2019 according to [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/hydrogen)). In May, Sinopac (China Petroleum & Chemical Corp with US$ 314 bln market cap) announced building of 20 H2 refill stations in Guangzhou City. Sinopac has built 2 model gas/hydrogen refill stations, and will be accelerating build out in Beijing to support fuel cell powered cars for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic.\\n\\n2021\\n\\nExample of hydrogen refueling stations: Hyfun.cn has 9 stations in operation. 20 more under construction. Has served 64k refuels, totaling 510 tons of hydrogen. InPower (LOOP\\'s partner in China) is promoting hydrogen production from methanol (China has a ton of cheap coal which could be used to produce methanol instead of burning to produce energy). InPower products include: hydrogen production devices, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, DC-to-DC fuel cells for 5,30,60KW outputs. InPower was established in 2008, with 110 employees (30 PhD researchers). In April InPower-Loop venture announced the 3 year contract  for \\\\~100 range extenders (50KW)  from Nanjing city bus (fleet of 7000). InPower-Loop established the Nanjing office in Jan 2020. Took 2 months to sign the contract. In June a first model bus was completed. In Aug 2020, production and research facility in Nanjing office was completed. Nanjing City (8 million population, and capital of Jiangsu Province with 80 mln population) has been lagging in hydrogen investment until the range extender investment, and the city has intention to apply for hydrogen model city (in order to obtain strategic investment funds from the Central Government which is awarded on a first-come-first-serve basis).',\n",

       "              \"A nice little tidbit about hydrogen gas. Germany is subsidizing trillions into BP for green H2 gas. I would look for correlations between Germany and an H2 cell provider. \\n\\nWhy I would wait on investing into h2 cells: Our technology in h2 fuels is still stoneage. Yes we have them working, yes, there is a lot of potential energy there. The efficiency of the gas combined with the scarcity of pumps right now, would make this a long long long term investment. That, to me, seems like making a hail mary to pick a single company. In my humble opinion, I think investing in FSKR would be a more plausible hail Mary.\\n\\nWhy?\\nThey are coming out with their Ocean in q4 2022. That's likely before H2 takes off and their lease program is going to crush Uber's rates for frequent fliers. They have a more reputable parts supply than previous. The bankruptcy is the only thing that would turn me away. I just see fisker pumping out products well before h2 innovates its way into normal everyday life. You have Tesla to fight for that car market too... \\n\\nTLDR; if I wanted to risk money on a eco car venture, I'd probably pick fisker. By the time FSKR pops or flops, h2 will still be low cost.\",\n",

       "              'Sustainability is a pretty meaningless term that companies like to use to make their products more appealing to the eco-conscious consumer. The best eco-friendly solution would be for fashion companies to shut their doors and only allow for second-hand to be purchased thus reducing and prohibiting any textile waste from being created but we know that\\'s impossible. Capitalism drives companies to sell as much as possible so even if the textiles are being produce in a way that impacts the environment a little less than another technique the sheer volume of goods they\\'re producing and selling will inevitably impact the environment catastrophically. They are just slowing the inevitable, by simply existing they are a detriment to this planet. That being said we all love our luxury goods whether they are real or fake but limiting what you buy is really the only way to stop emissions and save the planet, but if everyone did that it would cause these companies to collapse since they wouldn\\'t move any inventory. This creates a game of convincing the consumer that their purchases will have a lesser impact on the environment and \"greenwash\" their products to make it more friendly for the eco-conscious consumer which makes this sustainability trend meaningless since it is all about selling product and not a real solution to the issue. That being said worker\\'s rights is something that companies have more control over and it is shocking to see how low LVMH ranked but not surprising. When we think about fake luxury fashion we are made to think of terrorism, child labor and drugs but we seldom discuss the abuses that are happening from the luxury houses like LVMH. Since the price is so high we are made to think that they are crafted with the upmost care and workers are treated like royalty but it just shows you how much marketing and fear mongering can sway the opinion of the masses. This issue of sustainability and human rights abuses is an inherent consequence of capitalism that needs to be addressed in all industries not just fashion.',\n",

These luxury brands will keep on producing until we stop buying. They are beholden to their stakeholders and clients. With the pandemic, there have been many statements made by fashion designers and fashion houses that they will reduce the number of their annual collections. While promising, that remains to be seen. I compare this to the companies posting BLM advocacy but still not hiring POC or not conducting comprehensive checks on their racial biases. Going back to fashion, sustainability is in the eye of the beholder. Is Hermes practicing sustainability by limiting the number of bags they release? Depends on who's asking. How does BoF come up with metrics? Are these metrics the gold standard in the industry? So many questions and factors to consider. But at the end of the day, we the consumers, hold the key to sustainability. We can dictate how much we want these fashion houses to produce and how they should ethically produce their products. We should be cautious in buying the idea that some companies are 'green' while at the same breathe they are part of the fast fashion. We should also hold ourselves accountable for the manner, speed, and amount we consume things.\\n\\nIf there's one thing that the pandemic and idea of sustainability have taught me, it is to clutch my purse tighter and be more mindful of spending my coins. :)\",\n",

Its main competitors are Jumbo and Plus, but I would say Albert Heijn has the strongest branding.\\n\\n- Bol.com: As OP notes, this is the biggest e-commerce brand in the Netherlands and Belgium. I order from them every now and then. Their service is great and prices are often somewhat competitive. Nevertheless, Amazon is starting to become a bigger and bigger threat. At the moment the two can co-exist, but since the launch of Amazon.nl (March 2020), I believe things have started to change. \\n\\nAmazon.nl is slowly ramping up its marketing and with the emergence of Amazon’s Dutch platform, I think Bol.com should seriously start to get worried. In my experience, Amazon.nl is cheaper in about 60% of cases. Previously, Dutch people had to order from foreign Amazon platforms (e.g. Amazon.de), but this is no longer the case. \\n\\nAll in all, I believe Ahold Delhaize will continue to do well in the short term. However, Bol.com should start taking Amazon.nl seriously as a competitor. If prices are going to determine the winner, Amazon.nl is likely to dominate the Dutch e-commerce scene IMO.',\n",

How do you approach communicating with the general public? \\n\\nIn my view, sustainability/environmental professionals are in danger of confusing consumers to the point of inaction. \\n\\nPlastic grocery bags are a good example. Selecting paper over plastic doesn\\'t have much of a beneficial impact, if it even has a  positive impact at all. And yet for a period, consumers acted as if that decision was most important environmental decision that they made in the supermarket. (And we know it\\'s very, very far from that.) \\n\\nIn my view, professionals like you need to focus on recommendations about *product-category* decisions rather than *product* decisions, and make recommendations that are easy to understand and (hopefully) follow. \\n\\nDon\\'t tell people which car to buy (a product-level decision), tell them how to get the service of transportation (a product-category decision). Walking, biking, and taking mass transit (product category) are all much more important than selecting a Camry versus an Accord (product-level). \\n\\nRecommendations at the product level (e.g., taking Colgate toothpaste over Crest) tend to be sensitive to where the person is living and what environmental impacts they care most about. They\\'re fragile recommendations (e.g., because they rely on assumptions and data they rely on aren\\'t particularly generalizable). And so, professionals in this field end up sending mixed messages to consumers who want to care, but get disheartened when they put effort into doing the right thing, and it turns out that it\\'s not the right thing after all. \\n\\nIt reminds me of the nutrition field, which can\\'t make up it\\'s mind about a lot of different foods, such as eggs. Are they good or bad for you? They\\'re not really clear either way, so as a consumer, I eventually say, \"Forget it.

Without a change in this kind of economic model, do you see this burden being minimized to a point of sustainability? Is there a push for modular engineering to reduce the amount of waste we create? I feel this is an aspect of sustainability that I rarely hear mentioned. I am very passionate about it though and would love to  find out more ways to help create solutions. Do you have any recommendations on how I can create the biggest impact in this area? Thank you so much for your time. Keep on fighting the good fight, it \\n means the world, literally! \",\n",

       "              'Hey guys. I work in sustainability, specifically agriculture, and have been working on a theory or belief for a while and wanted your input.\\n\\nIn my experience, there are two main \"camps\" in agriculture. The \"conventional\" group which experiences great yields, uniformity, reliability, etc, but which can have very high inputs and sometimes negative effects on the environment.\\n\\nThe other camp is the \"organics\" type guys. They tend to have much lower yields, but also lower inputs and fewer negative impacts.\\n\\nI have worked in both groups, and noticed a distinct polarization. Those in the organics tend to speak vitriol about conventional growers as if they were monsters, and although they often have their heart in the right place they are usually delusional about the practical chances of replacing conventional production with their style while feeding the ever growing population.\\n\\nThose in the conventional group tend to reject anything that even suggests organics/sustainability outright as if there were nothing to it.\\n\\nSo to conclude my rant, my belief (have grown MILLIONS of vegetable plants in every different system possible) is that we need some sort of hybrid system combining the best of both worlds. Things such as bacterial and fungal symbiosis have been shown to have fantastic benefits even in hydroponic scenarios, and bio-control of pests is becoming even more attractive as pesticide resistance increases. Conversely, some things are conventional for a reason. Many nutrients simply do not become soluble enough for effective drip use, and there are many VERY labor-intensive things required for non-conventional growth (like tilling, filling bags, flushing pipes, etc) which in some cases drive the labor costs so high that it offsets any benefits the system would have.\\n\\nSo, do you think that there should be more co-operation between conventional and organic-sustainable-ecofriendly agriculture?',\n",

The manufacturer is selling their credibility in exchange for ensuring certain processes are followed for reliability, and those excess costs get passed on to the consumer.\\n\\nAs well, most shops are loathe to install customer-provided parts because there\\'s a lot of additional risk in doing so.  For instance, if the drive fails a month later who is responsible for that?  Was it the part that failed, or was it due to shoddy workmanship?  What if the failure isn\\'t explicit and is instead smaller behavior issues? Do enough work with end consumers and you\\'ll know that many people will do whatever they can to save a dime.   \"Here\\'s my new 1TB M.2 SSD that I got from a sketchy Chinese auction site!\" is followed up with the inevitable \"Hey, this thing only storing up to 120GB, you clearly broke it when you installed it and I want my money back!\" which is further time and effort expended in the name of dealing with a customer you voluntarily entered into a business arrangement with - if left unhappy, many customers will turn around and publicly trash your company and cost you further business even if you were explicit in what your workmanship entailed.\\n\\nIt\\'s great if you can find a mom & pop shop that is reliable, but the problem is finding those reliable shops.  Independent retailers all have different ideas on how business should be conducted, and like penny-pinching customers there are penny-pinching businesses as well.  What if they\\'re saving money by not having ESD protection in their shop?  The part failed - was it due to a bad part or their shoddy workmanship?  How do you know they\\'re actually competent at what they do and not just letting their 13 year old nephew do the installation?  What is your recourse if they damage your equipment and deny responsibility?\\n\\nAnd of course their $60 charge for 10 minutes of work seems expensive, but you\\'re not paying just for 10 minutes of work.  You\\'re paying for the rent for the shop to be there day in and day out.  You\\'re paying for the managers who schedule the techs, you\\'re paying for the unemployment insurance, you\\'re paying for the costs of their electricity and water so they can run in a habitable space, you\\'re paying for accounting work to make sure the books are balanced every month, you\\'re paying for the risks the owner started in opening their own shop, and you\\'re paying for the technician to be available when you decide on a Tuesday morning that you want your computer upgraded right then.  The shop has decided it costs a minimum of $60 per customer just to cover their own costs and ensure some profit at the end of the day.\\n\\nIt\\'s all a balancing act of various interests.  If you want a shop that you know is backstopped by a global manufacturer in regards to quality of workmanship, you pay more for that knowledge so they can be trained and certified.  They\\'re not paid to take risks, and the fact that they have to turn away some business to maintain certain standards means that they\\'re going to charge you more for their work as well.  If you want a shop that can save you money, you\\'re still paying to ensure all of their overhead is covered because you\\'re still choosing them as a source of knowledge and expertise that you yourself lack.',\n",

If you sign up as a consultant, you don't even have to do any work at all and you can just get the discount. That is where the 18.3% comes in. If you don't work the business you won't get paid. It's also really not hard to get paid from what I have heard firsthand. Not all MLM's are pyramid scheme. That is an uneducated statement. Some people immediately hear MLM and assume the worst. You should actually see what it really is all about. Pretty much every consultant is there to help people. To help them feel their best and look their best. So before you make claims like this, you should really look into it without bias. Forbes just wrote an article about Arbonne that you should check out. \\n\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bridgetarsenault/2020/05/21/may-little-black-book-of-health-beauty-and-wellness-practitioners/\",\n",

You have to actually do the fucking work, just like any other business. \\n\\n20% of small businesses fail in their first year, 30% fail in the first two years, and 50% of them fail in the first five years.\\n\\nFailure means money lost. Losing money isn\\'t something that only happens in social marketing businesses.\\n\\nTwo. \"Buying stock\" isn\\'t a normal or recommended situation. Having products you personally use, for the purposes of actually understanding what you\\'re marketing, and actually getting value yourself, is the normal. All orders are through an online shop... you never sell stock out of your own cabinet. Giving away samples? Sure. But orders are done externally to you, you don\\'t have to float the product. Ever. People order from an online shop, and you receive commission for creating that bridge. It\\'s hands off, for the people who already know what they want.\\n\\nThree. No income is made on the recruitment of consultants alone. Those consultants must sell products themselves, meaning people are purchasing products they enjoy or find value in, for their upline to make any extra income from people below them... people who are also recieving commission.\\n\\nYou guys can have whatever opinions you please.\\n\\nMy truth? My wife made an extra 14,000 dollars in her first 11 months of running an Arbonne side-hustle, with consistent growth. This is in addition to our main business, which charges $75/hr for coaching, $1,500/month for horse development, and grossed over 90k last year. She has long struggled with major skin problems, and inflammation... not anymore. Her mother lost 80 pounds in the last year, and is in the best shape since she was 25. A horsemanship client lost 75 pounds in the last 4 months, and is equally ecstatic about how much better she feels. A long list of people truly enjoy, and get value out of, a myriad of products that they use everyday.... and the only stock we have on hand is stuff that WE use everyday.\\n\\nOh, and all the consultants below her... who are actually doing the work... are paying their bills with the business, and doing it alongside what they were already doing. She doesn\\'t waste time with those not willing to do the work.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost like that long list of people not making any income, are people that suck at business, and signed up for \"easy money,\" when there is no such thing, in any business.\\n\\nRoast away... our accounts don\\'t mind.',\n",

First, let\\'s talk about efficiency. You mention the energy generation industry. Now, the experts in energy are generally people working in that industry already. The energy generation industry will pay the highest wages for such experts. No committee of generalists - no matter how talented - is likely to perform better than the experts already within an industry. In addition, many parts of the energy industry are competitive. Oil extraction, for example, is very competitive. In many developed countries there are markets for electricity which are also competitive. This means that the most competent organizations succeed, and that the best ideas succeed. Let\\'s say that the R&D department of an electricity company comes up with an optimization for it\\'s power stations. If the optimization works then the business they work for will make greater profits. The procedure will then be copied by others. There is no need for any central committee of generalists to be convinced before anything can happen. Different businesses can experiments and takes different paths. Those that make the best decisions will make the most profit.\\n\\nThe markets also respond quickly to changes in conditions. Far quicker than a large organization could. Producers can choose what inputs then use and vary them over time. If the price of an input rises then other inputs can be used as a substitute. Take the electricity pool markets, for example. When there are high winds the price of wind power falls, so more of it is bought. Other electricity producers then decrease their own output. A more long-term example is the car market. Car bodywork can be made of steel, aluminium or glass-fibre. When the price of one material falls it makes that material more attractive to car makers. It doesn\\'t matter to the car makers exactly why the material changes in price. That\\'s a matter for the makers of those materials. Those further up the chain only see the price change. In this way prices signal scarcity. If a price rises it means that the quantity supplied has fallen or that the quantity demanded has risen. In either case it is efficient to reduce the consumption of that good. The price rise encourages that reduction. So, there is no real reason to change from what we have now.\\n\\nThe exception to all this is environment issues. Producers often create emissions which are costs for other people. For example, coal fired power stations produce carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Farmers using fertilizer and pesticides create run-off. Aerosol cans used to create CFC emissions. All of these things are not priced into the cost of the corresponding activities. However, central organization is not the best way to solve this problem. We can preserve the beneficial effects of markets. One way to do this is to tax these emissions. This tax is designed to capture the cost of the activity to other parties. This is why many countries have carbon taxes or systems of credits for pollution (\"cap-and-trade\"). For other pollutants outright bans are more appropriate.',\n",

Indeed, the best I\\'ve heard is \"socially responsible investing is whatever the investor believes it is.\" For me, the best example of this is Shell. Oil producing companies can\\'t be green can they? Well, most esg scores are comparing a company to its overall industry so it may well come out looking very green. They also invest in renewables so depending on the screens used it may look like a green investment. \\n\\nThere were a few WSJ investigations and found that there were essentially zero correlation between esg scores of one provider compared to another, and that many funds had just changed their name to include the word\" green\" or \"sustainable\" etc without changing the portfolio.\\n\\nTheoretically speaking, imagine a company like PG Tips. How can one accurately or precisely estimate its environmental impact? Are they going to annually sample their farms, their HQ for water usage etc? And then consider that PG Tips\\' score will get augmented with all the other Unilever subsidiaries into one value. It seems like an absurd task to me.\\n\\nCrucially, large caps like the Vanguard one will contain almost the same as a normal world index, but likely have higher fees. I wouldn\\'t recommend it imo, and go for a big standard world index with low fees.\\n\\nI would also note that you\\'re investing in the secondary market - unless the company is issuing shares (v unlikely) then your investment won\\'t have a direct impact.

Puoi tranquillamente fare qualcosa di originale e significativo, ma tieni in mente che dietro ogni paper che leggi c'è almeno un anno di lavoro quasi full time (che diventano 3 o 4 se la rivista è prestigiosa) e diverse versioni. Io proverei a fare qualcosa di fatto bene, con una parte empirica ben strutturata ma non impossibile. Cerca di capire bene qual è l'approccio metodologico più usato nel settore (se riesci evita il solito OLS oppure fai vedere che tutte le assumption sono rispettate) e quali sono i problemi che cerca di correggere (endogeneity, collinearity, overidentification, etc...).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIl tema che hai scelto è molto interessante ma vasto. Senza sapere da quali articoli sei partito è difficile capire esattamente quali sono le tue basi. Proprio oggi stavo cercando articoli sugli ETF e ne ho trovato uno che confrontava i rendimenti degli ETF durante l'ultimo anno per vedere se quelli con score ESG più alti avessero performato meglio ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102051)). Secondo me potresti pensare di fare qualcosa di simile e vedere i rendimenti delle imprese quotate (i dati sono più facili da trovare) e magari confrontare diversi modelli per calcolare i rendimenti attesi (CAPM, Fama French, etc) includendo un controllo per l'ESG score. Sicuramente sarà un lavoro originale visto che è un tema attuale e pochi hanno avuto il tempo di pubblicare qualcosa a riguardo. In generale, prima di perdere troppo tempo a definire la struttura della tesi controlla sempre se i dati che ti servono sono reperibili attraverso la tua università. Per esempio, i dati finanziari delle srl sono abbastanza facili da trovare in Italia (AIDA o Orbis), ma quasi impossibili per imprese inglesi o americane (credo che in Italia solo Bocconi e Luiss abbiano l'abbonamento ai quei database).\",\n",

There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns.

There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. \\n\\nThere was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account.

For one thing, when you buy a stock (unlike when you buy a product), almost all the time you are getting the stock from another investor on the secondary market and aren’t giving any money to the company itself. That means selling a company’s stock is not like refusing to buy its products; it’s more like refusing to buy used products made by that company and sold by someone else. You at most indirectly hurt the company by making its stock price go down, and I doubt ESG investing will ever be big enough to accomplish that, especially because an unethical company that is underpriced should attract more investment from profit-maximizing investors. Potentially, a very rich person or fund could try to get so many shares that they can have significant voting rights and then direct the company to be more ethical, but at that point they are not really investing in the ordinary person sense.\\n\\nFor another thing, it’s really hard to know what companies are actually ethical, and outsourcing this to a manager is questionable too because the manager may have different ethics than you. Is it more ethical to invest in a tech company that creates no jobs or a sweatshop company that creates a lot of low-paying jobs?

The rest is sourced directly via links in the text. Please watch the video first, as it is necessary context for this post.**\\n\\nESG investing yields lower returns compared to non-ESG funds in the same sectors and exposed to the same factors (like small cap, growth, etc.) This is theoretically justified and historically evident. The reasons have nuance but let me put it simply: When a large (but not unanimous) portion of the market is receiving a consumptive good benefit (i.e., you are getting a social, personal, or psychological reward) for investing in a certain kind of asset, or excluding a certain kind of asset, then the price of that asset will be higher than a comparable asset that carries no such benefit. This means you overpay and have lower expected future returns. The inverse is also true: If you pay a non-financial cost for investing in a certain asset, you will underbuy that asset, and thus it will be cheaper. Think about the social, psychological, or reputational costs you might incur for telling your friends, neighbors, teachers, or political allies that you invest in private prison companies. When this dynamic is at play for some, but not all of the market, the portion of the market that is doing the \"ESG investing\" is by definition expecting lower future returns. This fact is unavoidable from an economic lens, and has been confirmed empirically.\\n\\nFelix in the video also goes into more depth about other adjacent reasons that this must hold. One is the fact that there is, of course, a level of return differential between ESG and non-ESG investing that would cause even the most fervent ESG investors to stop ESG investing, and this fact alone means that non-ESG investing has a higher expected return. Also, the MORE people invest in ESG, the LOWER the expected return for someone buying in or holding those assets becomes. Some people are tempted to think to themselves, \"I\\'ll buy ESG funds in the hopes that in the future, more people than ever buy ESG funds\" but this is an explicit greater-fool theory of investing that -never works for the majority who participate in it, by definition.- With 25% of US stock money being in ESG funds (and 50% of Canadian $!), who is really the fool? When the top suggested ETFs by the entire internet tend to be explicit ESG plays like clean energy ETFs and ARK funds, where are you on the fool continuum for buying or holding those assets? Greater-fool speculative market timing doesn\\'t work, but what you can be sure of, in this circumstance, is that you are buying overpriced equities that will depress future returns when things return to their fundamentals...this is a logically necessary, unavoidable implication if fund flows are determining price increases!\\n\\nOne might point out, \"but look how good X industry has done! Clean energy has outperformed fossil fuels!\" This is a tempting response, but the researchers aren\\'t stupid. Certain factors are always outperforming other factors, and in this case, growth companies and tech companies have been on an incredible run. The authors -already control- for sector, size, momentum, value/growth, investment, profitability, and so on. When you control for all of that, then look specifically at the differences between two batches of companies that are equivalent in every financially relevant way, but one has ESG designations and one doesn\\'t, the ESG underperforms. ESG funds are indeed in sectors and factors that have outperformed, but they UNDERPERFORMED relative to non-ESG holdings in those same sectors and factors. ESG-ness itself turns out to be a net harm to returns both in theory and in practice.\\n\\nThe other aspects of the costs of ESG investing are even simpler and surely unlikely to be doubted, but I\\'ll quickly say them again. The fees of ESG funds are higher than the fees of other diversified market-weight index funds and targeted factor funds. The turnover is higher as well. Also, the difference in diversification is obvious...a subset of the market is never as diversified as the entire market. To remind people of the benefit of diversification: When you lower your diversification substantially, you raise your risk, raise your volatility, and increase uncertainty about future returns...and, crucially, lowering diversification does not increase your expected future returns. William F. Sharpe won a Nobel Prize in part for proving that you do not get paid for taking more risk when the risk can be diversified away. So not only does lowering diversification not increase future returns, in the case of ESG, it reduces your future returns as well.\\n\\nAnother aspect of ESG investing not covered in the video but more than worth mentioning, is that ESG stocks tend to be in the category of stocks that have the -lowest historical and expected returns of the entire market-. The authors of the study control this away in order to isolate ESG-ness, but let me also share the factor information of the companies you are buying into. These companies tend to be growth stocks, almost all of them are unprofitable, and they are biased toward being small, and they exhibit high positive skewness (they have a higher-than-normal chance to have massive returns). Small cap, unprofitable growth stocks are the [Black Hole of Investing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avoid-the-black-hole-of-investing/). From the [Lottery Ticket Effect](https://www.etf.com/sections/index-investor-corner/swedroe-investors-prefer-gambling-stocks?nopaging=1) where investors consistently overpay for stocks that have a higher chance of massive short term returns, leading to lower total average returns, to the fact that [they have liquidity problems and are difficult to short](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedroe-rediscovering-size-effect-233000204.html), leading to prices being set systematically higher than they should because the market is unable to knock them down, ESG investing biases toward market segments that are are bad, bad, bad, and bad. Not to mention, [\"technological revolution\" investing tends to be a loser\\'s game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnVt_CvL3k), with prices being very prone to bubble behavior and consistent overpricing and lower returns relative to declining industries. I\\'ll say it again, recent massive overperformance of ESG industries/factors is not a counterargument here...it is just further reason to believe that you are not getting a deal or buying/holding underpriced stocks.\\n\\nESG investing is the -opposite- of a free lunch. It harms your portfolio in just about every way that a portfolio can be harmed. If more people interested in ESG investing knew this, I suspect they may think twice about whether they are willing to sacrifice so much [for so little, if any positive impact on the world.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18136214/impact-investing-socially-responsible-sri-report) Consider keeping your portfolio invested rationally, with low cost total market indexes, potentially biased toward higher expected return assets in the market, like small cap value (AVUV, SLYV, AVDV) or emerging market stocks (VWO,AVEM), and then simply donating the money you can afford to the objectively most cost effective charities in the world, such as those identified by [https://www.givewell.org/](https://www.givewell.org/) and [https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) .

As far as I’m aware, the sovereign wealth fund does not invest in companies will produce or sell nuclear weapons. It also seeks to ban investment in illegal activities - forgive me for asking, but does the Minister think these illegal poachers or lumber mills are floating stocks on the markets? Does he believe that these immoral groups release their cash flow and operating revenue before going into Cambodia to cut down trees?\\n\\nWhat’s more - the bill seeks to propose a ban on gold and oil extraction which involves “unacceptable” environmental damage - will the Minister be founding a body to adjudicate on these issues?\\n\\nAgain on this issue - why is investment in the extraction of gold to be banned if it is “unacceptable”, but not other minerals such as silver, zinc, or lead, which may employ the exact same methods in harvesting ore?\\n\\nMr. Speaker, this Bill is a shoddy piece of work and the Minister needs to rewrite it or withdraw it entirely.

       "              \"Mr Speaker,\\n\\nThis bill perhaps has good intent but as it is the bill before this House promises to lead this nation to ruin. As I fear that it will pass this initial reading, I call on Members of Parliament to work on writing up amendments to it posthaste.\\n\\nFirst, let us point out the elephant in the room here; a savings fund is meant to bring the most return to its trustees in the determined period of time. By putting restrictions on the management of personal savings, as is the case of KiwiSaver, or the Government Superannuation Fund, meant for our hard-working state sector employees, this government opens up the possibility for these funds to be more reliant on worse investments. Not only does this directly undermine the idea of the funds serving those who benefit from it, it also opens up risk within this funds. With worse investments, it means that more of them will likely become loss-making and therefore increase the chance that the funds remain healthy, safe ways for our citizens and state sector employees to rely on. It really is irresponsible the way that the government currently pursues a policy with such disregard for both the financial health of individuals and those it directly hires.\\n\\nNow, Mr Speaker, I'd like to address the issues related to the terms of the bill. We see the terms 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' littered about, but what does it actually mean? Luckily the Minister for Foreign Affairs has put these sections in next to ones which actually do have meaning, but as it is the term 'ethical' in this bill is just pandering and meaningless because it is undefined and left for the bureaucrats who enforce the bill to determine. Do we want unelected people to determine what is ethical on behalf of the country? I am not so sure. \\n\\nAs for the stricter guidelines in this bill found in Schedule 1, there are multiple glaring issues there as well. There is the awkwardly-worded phrase 'investments will not invest in investments involved in', one which lacks clarity whatsoever. The use of 'involved' also begs the question, what does it mean to be 'involved'? The bill must define this lest bureaucrats determine with levity what 'involvement' exactly means. Even if no other amendment passes, this part must be fixed or there will be no comprehensible reading of this bill. The bill also condemns those firms dealing with the 'manufacture of addictive substances'. May I ask what substances in particular? As written this bill could cause our funds to direct investment away from companies that make everything from video games to chocolate pudding! It needs more clarity once again. Then this bill brings up legality and human rights, one of the most unclear issues of them all here. What's an 'illegal activity' exactly? Is it just an environmental crime such as poaching or could it be any crime under any law? Could chewing gum be an 'illegal activity' under this bill since it's prohibited in Singapore? The Minister who presented this bill ought to define what is and is not illegal. In Schedule 1, (1)(e) also raises questions. Why are unconstitutional statuses necessarily negative and what qualifies as repressive? Furthermore, most countries, including this one, violate human rights of some sort. I say this again: this bill cannot be accepted without more clarification. Yes, these terms in Schedule 1 are just meant to be guidelines. These guidelines must be clear and sound however, because so many of our citizens and state sector employees depend on these funds for their savings. For such a topic of high-importance, vague suggestions should not be tolerated.\\n\\nMr Speaker, I ask that the Deputy Prime Minister withdraw this bill and rewrite it himself. Otherwise, substantive revision must occur in the amendment reading. If neither of these things happen, it ought to be rejected outright by this House, for the sake of the people's interest. \",\n",

       "              \"Kia ora, Mr Speaker. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou, kia ora.\\n\\nMr Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, because the Green Party is and has always been a vocal supporter of ethical, responsible, and sustainable investment.\\n\\nThere are a couple of objectives to this bill, effectively. The first is to make capital cheaper and more available to businesses that are acting responsibly, ethically, and sustainably. That's about using our government funds, whether New Zealand First's KiwiFund, the Cullen Fund, or the ACC fund, to support business that aren't destroying the planet, that aren't acting unethically- we want them to prosper. And conversely, for businesses that are acting unethically and inappropriately, for them we want to make capital more expensive and less available.\\n\\nThe second underlying objective is to ensure New Zealand, as a country, lives and acts in a way that is ethical and responsible. It is no surprise that, for example, numerous KiwiSaver providers adhere to some ethical investment criteria, or at least provide an ethical option. We want to be living off these funds in a way that is socially responsible, that will shift the world in a more ethical and sustainable and humane direction.\\n\\nIt took years of effort to fight the unethical investments of the Cullen fund, and even today the fund still remains invested in numerous things that we, as a nation, should not be backing, and should not be trying to profit off. The Greens campaigned to get the fund out of whale meat, tobacco, and cluster funds, which was successful, but today still the fund is invested in Rio Tinto and Freeport-McMoRan, two of the largest mining companies, causing irreparable environmental damage to both land and our climate- and of course, climate change is a global issue. The fund is invested in Gazprom, the third worst industrial carbon dioxide emitter in the world. ExxonMobil, the fourth worst. The fund is invested in Halliburton, the company who profiteered off of the Iraq war. BAE Systems,  United Technologies Corp, Rolls-Royce, Babcock International, Safran- all involved in the production of nuclear weapons, and all financed by the Cullen fund. We can learn from Norway, who's pension fund has sensible ethical criteria, and is not involved with so many of the unethical and irresponsible firms that our various funds are invested in.\\n\\nMr Speaker, this bill will steer New Zealand and it's investments in a direction that is ethical and responsible. That is responsible foreign policy, that is responsible human rights policy, and it is a policy that I am proud to see put forward to the house.\\n\\nNgā mihi.\",\n",

       "              ' Mr. Speaker, \\n\\nI come once again to comment on this bill. In the last reading, I expressed both a fundamental doubt regarding the concept of the bill and also an amendable, resolvable doubt about the language of it. I am sorry to say that neither have been assuaged.\\n\\nWith regards to the fundamental doubt, this would have to be the idea of restraining investment opportunities to start with. I am inclined to believe that the main goal of these funds should be to increase the rate of return on investment, as this benefits all of us as the public. We depend on these funds, workers depend on these funds. Yet, if they do not maximise returns, then it seems to me that they will become less efficient and harm all who depend on them. Furthermore, it also creates the chance of accruing losses over time as the funds become more emburdened by stringent guidelines and restraining rules. This should be an unacceptable risk to take in my opinion, since the costs could be large. However, when my Friend posed a question regarding these costs to the Deputy Prime Minister, instead of giving a clear, honest answer, he dodged it completely. This action did no favours in convincing me that this government neither knows what it is even doing with this bill nor has an understanding of the tangible consequences of it upon our country’s various funds. So on this count, I will oppose this bill. As an idea, perhaps it would be better to try and stamp out the undesirable activities directly through international and domestic rules and systems instead of relying on restraining and weakening our own crucial funds. I would see this method as one which reconciles all desires here, but it is one that this government has not opted to take.\\n\\nMr. Speaker, I also remember this bill as being generally imprecise with language and incorrect in application. Indeed, there is a significant, systematic  issue within the bill when the term ‘ethical’ is bandied about but no definition or clarification is added specifying it. So, in committee I did what I saw was my obligation in the face of almost certain passage of this bill by the government—no matter how poorly written the final product would be. I put forth multiple amendments which based the language of this bill on more solid foundations and real documents. Using this approach I believed, and still do believe, it made a better piece of legislation in the end because less of the bill’s application would be informed by some highly amorphous concept of ethics from each person who enforces this bill. People who manage our funds should have firm standards set into law simply because without guidelines, management of these critical funds will become more arbitrary and less predictable. Stability and consistent standards are essential for the sound management of critical state funds, and I had thought that this was an argument that all would have come to accept. Indeed, with these amendments any vote in favour would not have violated the coalition agreement nor would it have softened this bill. Yet, these amendments, save the one to Schedule 1, failed to pass and this also serves as a reason to oppose this bill. We cannot tolerate the imprecise language here since it could create unacceptable costs in the same vein as those derived from the restrictions to begin with. While I celebrate the acceptance of the amendment to Schedule 1, an amendment which fixes many of the bill’s flaws, it does not go far enough in rectifying the bill’s problems with vagueness. On this count, too, I will oppose this bill.\\n\\nMr. Speaker, I will vote against this bill unfortunately. I had hoped to be able to support it for the final reading but it will not be possible due to the failure to resolve serious doubts and preventable errors. I encourage my fellow MPs to do the same.',\n",

This bill is about ensuring that our Crown investment agencies don\\'t try to profit off of pain, misery, and suffering. This bill is about ensuring that ethical investment criteria is set in law, not just reliant on whether or not the current Superannuation fund guardians believe it\\'s a good idea or not. It\\'s also about streamlining this minimum criteria across all our Crown investment agencies.\\n\\nUp and down New Zealand, we are seeing consumers place more and more value on ethical conduct and sustainability. Companies are forced to take positive steps to reducing their environmental impact, people care more about purchasing fair trade products, and the like. People care about the impact their money has on the world around them. Our Crown investment agencies must be receptive to that demand as they invest taxpayer money, and use our money wisely on the international market, as consumers do at the supermarket. We owe it to consumers to make the obligations of our Crown investment agencies crystal clear in our statute books\\n\\nWe cannot bandy around our \"100% pure NZ\" slogan whilst investing in companies that actively destroy the environment. I know the National Party wants to have their cake and eat it too, but we can\\'t pretend to be environmental leaders by investing in environmental destruction. We can\\'t pretend to be responsible global citizens whilst financing the global arms trade. We can\\'t be a nuclear-free nation if we invest in companies that produce nuclear weapons. It\\'s this two hats mentality, that it\\'s out of sight and out of mind, which we must reject.\\n\\nWe must move from a passive position on ethics and sustainability and take a more active role. The opposition is scared of putting our money where out mouth is as a nation, and that doesn\\'t surprise anyone. This is a courageous step forward, marking the interests of New Zealand loud and clear on the world stage.\\n\\nI must note it\\'s quite ironic to hear National members accuse this government of trying to \\'railroad through\\' legislation, considering the last government\\'s abuses of urgency, rushing through unpopular legislation at the last minute without any chance for public oversight. No, this government still stands for transparency and accountability, following through with the appropriate parliamentary procedure, and most importantly, listening to voters. Perhaps that explains why they\\'re in opposition.\\n\\nNevertheless, I commend this principled and forward-thinking bill to the house, a bill that prioritises New Zealand\\'s interests as an ethical and sustainability-focussed nation, soundly rejecting the opposition\\'s penchant for environmental destruction.',\n",

Therefore, if only people who don\\'t care about social responsibility (as a core value of the corporation, at least) hold shares, the company is going to be only as responsible as it has to in order to keep the shares moving up in price or paying dividends.  If people want to MAKE a company more socially responsible, then enough of those people need to buy stock that they can fight for a board seat or, most desirably, a majority of seats.  For most large corporations, it is totally infeasible to execute such a grassroots investor strategy due to the number of common shares on the market, but if no one ever buys the shares then there will be no impetus to change the status-quo.  Every time you hear about \"quarter capitalism\" being a bad influence, you are seeing the effects of this same ideal being implemented in the other direction, as investors with access to huge pools of capital use that money to influence corporate governance and change management culture.',\n",

Hate to say it, but ESG is just another one. \\n\\nPeople forget this even though it should be obvious, but all hedge funds/mutual funds/PE firms/VC firms have short/medium/long term marketing plans. There are marketing and business development people whose job it is to take the temperature of the world and make sure the firm is positioned properly. \\n\\nFor example, for the last ~5 years, *everything* is ‘quant’-this and ‘quant’-that. Did funds *really* change their strats? Fuck no. What they did was pay some data aggregator $1M for data access and hire some guy with a MS in statistics to crunch data, *and then went back to doing what they were already doing.* The stat guys job is to provide a ‘quant’ rationale for a decision after the fact. Occasionally, they *might* add some a priori ideas to the ‘investment mix’. \\n\\nI’m saying this bc I’ve worked buyside structures credit for over 10 years are we are *very* quant focused (yeah, I was a quant before it was cool) - but my peers and I laugh at what other firms try to get away with under the guise of ‘quant driven’.\\n\\nNow to ESG - we have a great marketing/BD teams and we are already trying to figure out how to pitch our funds as having an ESG focus without changing our process. For example, I’m already into an energy credit trade - fossil fuels are the opposite of ‘ESG’, right? So I’ll have a junior go find me a way to frame the trade. The credit we bought comes from an oil company that invests a tiny bit in renewables? Perfect! “We chose this credit for both the risk oppy AND due to our commitment to supporting companies the focuses on ESG.” In reality I didn’t change shit. This was the same with ‘quant’, ‘woman focused’, ‘Corp governance’, ‘Corp social responsibility’ etc. \\n\\nTLDR: ESG is a marketing phrase and little more.

       "              \"There seems to be interest by members of this subreddit to discuss / learn more about impact investing, so here is a thread for us to talk about it and where I can share as much information as possible.\\n\\n**MY BACKGROUND:** 5+ years of private equity / private debt theme-based impact investing with a focus on climate change, the circular economy and sustainable cities & communities. I work closely with the UN on financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) which recently recognised me as one of 50+ industry leaders worldwide. I am NOT a public markets expert, nor do I know absolutely everything about impact investing. This industry is fast moving, and I learn something new everyday.\\n\\n**PRIMER:** The image that I linked to this post is the responsible investing spectrum. I’ve found it to be a very good primer when discussing impact investing and how it positions itself versus other types of investments. To summarize the spectrum in plain English:\\n\\n* **Traditional investing**: Does not take into account Environmental, Social or Governance (ESG) considerations when making an investment decision. These types of investors only focus on financial returns.\\n* **Responsible investing**: These investors take into account ESG in their risk mitigation strategy. Roughly 25% (roughly $20 Trillion) of all professionally managed assets around the world take into account ESG when making an investment decision (i.e the orange “ESG risk management” bar on the image). Based on existing commitments, it is expected that this percentage will rise to roughly 75% of assets under management (AUM) by 2030 (NEED TO ADD CITATION)\\n\\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#430d6f2d1695](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#430d6f2d1695)\\n\\n[https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/the-rise-of-responsible-investment-fs.html](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/the-rise-of-responsible-investment-fs.html)\\n\\n* **Sustainable / socially responsible investing:** These types of investors don’t just see ESG issues as a risk to mitigate, but they believe that ESG can create opportunities for the companies.\\n* **Impact Investing:** Impact investing is defined as “Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. Impact investing can be split into two categories depending on the financial returns targeted:\\n\\no **Theme based impact investing** (this is what I do)**:** These types of investors seek market rate returns alongside the positive impact generated by their investments.\\n\\no **Impact First investing:** These investors are willing to sacrifice some financial return in the hopes of generating more impact; basically have a higher impact per dollar.\\n\\n* **Philanthropy:** These investors either seek capital preservation (no returns) or offer grants and loss capital (negative returns). I know it looks really weird to put philanthropy on an investment spectrum, and in most cases I would not consider what they do as investing, however when it comes to impact investing these people often play a key role in **blended finance** investments. In these types of investments, the philanthropic capital provide a first loss guarantee / transfer their pro rata returns to other investors; thus derisking the investment opportunity for other investors and catalysing more capital to address the social, economic or environmental issue that they are trying to address.\\n\\n[http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/blended-finance.htm](http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/blended-finance.htm)\\n\\n**KEY FACTS & FIGURES:**\\n\\nA lot of the information here comes from various studies published by the GIIN, you can find them here : [https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/](https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/)\\n\\n\\\\- Size of the market: $502 Billion in 2018. It is expected that the global impact investing market has reached $1 Trillion in 2019\\n\\n\\\\- About two-thirds of investors seek market-rate returns (66%), and the remaining third are split between those targeting returns closer to market rate (19%) and those targeting returns closer to capital preservation (15%).\\n\\nAs a side note, the vast majority (roughly 90%) of studies show that investments that incorporate ESG analysis outperform non-ESG investments in the long term. This is probably why such a large portion of the financial industry is switching over to ESG strategies.\\n\\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/22/does-esg-investing-produce-better-stock-returns.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/22/does-esg-investing-produce-better-stock-returns.aspx)\\n\\n[https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/195919/esg-funds-beat-non-sustainable-sister-funds.aspx](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/195919/esg-funds-beat-non-sustainable-sister-funds.aspx)\\n\\n**COMMON QUESTIONS / COMMENTS:**\\n\\n**What is the difference between a strong ESG company and an impact company?** For an impact company the impact scales with the size of the business (i.e impact generation IS the business plan), whereas for an ESG company that relationship does not necessarily hold true. For example, Coca cola scores quite well in ESG issues thanks to their sustainable supply chains, good governance etc. but at the end of the day their core business is drinks to people, so selling more doesn\\\\`t automatically mean they are generating more impact. A renewable energy company however generates impact from its core operations.\\n\\n**Is impact investing in public markets possible?** Historically impact investing has been private investments (debt and equity) since investors have much more control over the company’s impact generation. In my personal opinion, the majority of impact investing in public markets is baloney since investment managers follow a top down investment approach of successive screening. The best (and hardest) way to do impact investing in public markets is bottom up where you go from impact themes, look for companies that operate in those themes, identify the tope performing ones and invest. The best example I have found on the market of this is the Wellington Asset Management Impact strategy.\\n\\n[https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm\\\\_referrer=https://www.google.ca/](https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm_referrer=https://www.google.ca/)\\n\\n**Does impact investing actually generate the expected returns?** The link below is an oldy but goody (2017 with 2016 data). But long story short, yes the financial returns of impact investments are in line with their non impact peers for both market rate & below market rate investment strategies.\\n\\n[https://thegiin.org/assets/2017\\\\_GIIN\\\\_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments\\\\_Web.pdf](https://thegiin.org/assets/2017_GIIN_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments_Web.pdf)\\n\\n**Given it's a subset of the market, why do you think you are finding similar risk adjusted returns? Is it primarily due to government subsidy?**  For non-blended investments, I would argue that there are a few things driving returns:\\n\\n\\\\- More information = better investment decision making : when you're looking at a company / fund from an impact perspective, you're asking a lot more detailed questions about the business and you're getting much more familiar with the market.\\n\\n\\\\- Different investment opportunities : when you have a bottom up approach where you start from the problem you want to address then look for companies / solutions in that space, you find investment opportunities & strategies that nobody else / very few people have thought of. Given the glut of capital in the markets right now looking for investable opportunities, having fewer people around the table allows to to make better deals.\\n\\n**This is a whole load of impact-washing / green-washing baloney:**  This is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and the reason why organisations like the GIIN, UN etc. are working so hard to have proper industry standards for impact measurement, management and communication. A lot of progress has been made over the past year however with the launch of IRIS+ by the GIIN and the SDG certification framework by the UN.\\n\\n [https://iris.thegiin.org/](https://iris.thegiin.org/) \\n\\n [https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2019/UNDP\\\\_launches\\\\_standards\\\\_to\\\\_guide\\\\_private\\\\_sector\\\\_in\\\\_achieving\\\\_SDGs.html](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2019/UNDP_launches_standards_to_guide_private_sector_in_achieving_SDGs.html) \\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI'll try to update this post as questions / comments come in, or as I have the time to add links to relevant studies & articles.

At the micro level, this is easily understood: violent crime and destruction of property is bad, cleanliness and friendly neighbours are good.  People understand what it looks like to benefit the community at the micro level because direct causal relationships are super simple.\\n\\nAt the macro level, things get hazy.\\n\\nIs a company that provides a means for people in the community to convert labour into productivity at the cost of polluting the local water supply good?  Is a needle exchange that provides shelter for addicts but makes them visible to the community bad?\\n\\nGovernment and taxation enters the picture here as a solution to that question.  Because it\\'s difficult for a larger entity to comprehensively comport themselves in a manner which unequivocally \"benefits the community\", you outsource that burden to government, who steps in and says \"you don\\'t have to worry about micromanaging yourself for the benefit of the community, we\\'ll take care of that for you, but in exchange you have to give us money to do what you should have done on your behalf\".  It further follows that tax breaks for businesses make sense if they reduce the burden on government to manage their impact on the community (since they shouldn\\'t pay someone else to do something they\\'re already doing).  What does and doesn\\'t constitute them taking responsibility for their actions is up for discussion, but that\\'s a different matter.\\n\\nThings like paid sick leave are why this conversation needs to be had.  People being unable to tend to their own health because of work obligations is a community detriment directly caused by the existence of commercial activity.  SOMEONE needs to be responsible for this identifiable and measurable issue, and either that\\'s the businesses or it\\'s the government on their behalf.\\n\\nThis division between explicit and ambiguous detriments is why this conversation is so difficult to have.  You wouldn\\'t tolerate a business that murders children in the community because that\\'s bad, but a business that directly, measurably contributes to reductions in child safety due to pollution and burdens placed on parents is \"complicated\".\\n\\nThe conversation we should be having - the one a lot of talking heads want to steer you away from for vague reasons - is a ground-up community assessment: look at what problems exist in the community, look at the sources causing those problems, and then look at how to address those problems from the perspective that \"everything that happens in the community should benefit the community, and if it doesn\\'t, the things causing the detriment need to remediate the detriment or pay someone else to do so\".\\n\\nPeople unambiguously understand \"if someone murders, they should go to jail as a penalty because murdering hurts the community\", but thanks to decades of subtle messaging guidance, that same logic doesn\\'t apply to \"if someone weighs down the community with malicious business practices, they should be penalized for hurting the community by being forced to undo the hurt they caused\".

I\\'ve only seen lefties mention CSR as an on-its-face-ludicrous idea that buying into capitalist ideology will lead you to.\\n\\nThe obvious test case is: a company pollutes a river in a way which they realize will harm many people downstream, but which would be very difficult to detect and trace back to the company. They could prevent this pollution with an expensive mitigation system (which will only decrease profits, even in the long term), or they could let the people downstream be harmed. I think everyone should agree that the company has a clear moral obligation not to knowingly cause this harm. But the plain meaning of the phrase \"The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits\" indicates to me that Friedman disagrees?\\n\\nBy my reading of the essay, it\\'s somehow \"undemocratic\" to ask the factory owner not to pollute, which makes no sense to me. My view is that \"people doing good things is good\": I think excessive pollution / contributions to climate change are bad, so I think it\\'s good when private companies choose to use their own power in a way that mitigates these problems. It\\'s actually somewhat hard for me to see how I *could* be convinced that private companies *shouldn\\'t* voluntarily do more to combat climate change. *All* corporate actions are undemocratic, after all; corporations aren\\'t democratic governments. So that doesn\\'t seem to enter into the equation -- I think they should choose to do good things instead of choosing not doing good things.\\n\\nBut as I said, the whole line of argument leaves me so confused that I\\'m probably missing something.

The first is the one that you grapple with, which is essentially the moral question of whether business agents should have the power to utilize shareholder resources to pursue \\'social good\\'. It\\'s an interesting question, to be sure, but is ultimately a disagreement about values; I believe it possible to be morally consistent for the side of \"the business of business is business\" and the side that business needs to act with wider society in mind. I would have to dig through my old references to find scholarly arguments against the Friedman side - of which there are several serious efforts - but for a beginner\\'s book summary, Robert Frank\\'s \"What Price the Moral High Ground?\" is worth seeking out.\\n\\nHowever, the second question you only touch upon: should companies pursue CSR because it aligns with shareholder interest? Now, it has been three years since my thesis was published and I do not actively follow the literature, but at the time the evidence was quite robust that CSR does align with shareholder interest. Companies with CSR commitments outperform those without. And when I say \"outperform\", let me stress that this is not just naive correlations of CSR investment with profit levels or other such statistical handwaving. For example, one of the arguments in favour of organizations pursuing CSR was human resources - the standard of candidate is markedly higher (and a lot more cost efficient than salaries or benefits).',\n",

Government intervention\\'s result, despite stated intent, ends up *increasing* corporate power.\\n\\nHis position was [that social responsibility rests with individual people (timestamp)](https://youtu.be/ev_Uph_TLLo?t=173) because institutions  and other inanimate things can\\'t have responsibility, only people can have responsibility. And further that of the problems people face which call out for social responsibility [almost all of them are a result of government action](https://youtu.be/Rls8H6MktrA).\\n\\n>But critics of Friedman who advance this line of argument should be explicit and honest with themselves: they are advocating replacing democracy with technocracy, a system where the resolution of the challenges facing humans are best left to unelected experts.\\n\\nI personally would be much more sympathetic and understanding if people were willing to own up to this. It would be much easier to keep things civil. Unfortunately in most cases people arguing for corporate responsibility either don\\'t understand the implications of their demands, or they are unwilling to acknowledge them.\\n\\n>You can evaluate whether a marketing campaign was successful or not, but it’s much harder to determine whether a brand’s overall positioning is profit-maximising\\n>... I think the founders of such companies are trying to do good; still, one would have to be incredibly naive to not realise that the charitable component of their companies is a point of difference vs incumbents, and appeals to their demographics.\\n\\nThis is IMO the important nuance of the argument. Entrepreneurs often target a niche either because they themselves care about it, or know a lot about it. Often extant companies lack that knowledge and can\\'t target it without coming off as tonedeaf (e.g. [Kendal Jenner\\'s Pepsi ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwvAgDCOdU4)). I often see people arguing that a company could make more profit by not targeting their niche, without recognizing that the people who own and run the company may be targeting that niche because it is where their specific talents and knowledge give them an advantage. \\n\\nMaximizing profit isn\\'t merely about choosing the most profitable segment of a larger market, but about choosing the segment which *you and your employees* specifically are best able to serve competitively. There may frequently be things that would objectively raise profits, but which the specific people involved are unable to think of or unable to execute on for one reason or another.

I'm not sure exactly what the cause is, but it seems like people would rather provide inefficient help because it makes them feel better.

I think your article makes a couple of interesting points in summary what I got was that, stakeholders capitalism doesn't mean we get unicorns and fairies (the Koch brothers advocating for deregulation was a good example), and that companies can still advocating for progressive causes while increasing profits aligning with shareholders (Toms, Like a girl campaign etc.) .\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI still however remain unconvinced about shareholder capitalism, while I get the theory of shareholder capitalism, I think it is more of the implementation/culture of shareholder capitalisms that people criticize more than the theory. Take for example stock buy backs, despite some companies spending close to their market cap on stock buy backs over the course of a decade the stock won't even grow (IBM, GE, CITI) , never the less  buybacks continue with these companies and not on other types of capitol allocation like M&A, or R&D. I think what people would want, is managers and employees to have more autonomy over how to run their business rather than having to answer to some Hedge Fund manger every quarter about why they haven't given a better stock buyback yet. Yes Friedman is right in that corporations can only focus on profits or free cash flow, and not on some fuzzy concept of social responsibility.  I do think it is the responsibility of the government to align shareholder value with profits though, even Charles Koch would argue that not all profits are good for society. Some examples could be having stock buybacks be taxed like dividends, incentivizing more R&D through tax breaks, and giving managers/other stakeholder more voting rights over corporate governance (perhaps Germany's two tier system could be a good model for this [Aktiengesellschaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft)).\",\n",

I think the same as any other investments in a lot of ways. Specifically ESG - always make sure you are comparing apples to apples. A lot of ESG funds that sound the same are not because they are tracking different indexes, or because they have different screening criteria.  For example, some funds invest in fossil fuels but only the \"best\" fossil fuel companies etc, while some totally exclude fossil fuels. Make sure you understand what is in the fund you are buying at least enough to make you comfortable. The more \"strict\" your personal criteria is, the harder it will potentially be for you to choose one. \\n\\nBe aware of how currency and what accounts you are holding things in affects your investments.

Ie, a lot of big SRI/ESG ETFs and Mutual funds invest in Facebook, Apple, etc. If you want to avoid carbon emissions and do any one other thing around social justice (minority/female board representation, workers rights, etc) the universe of assets you can invest in shrinks really quickly. For example: the GAP low-ish carbon footprint (because they are a store); largely female leadership with a pipeline of other female leaders (some of them even POC!) Double good. Then Boom! Fast casual is one of the biggest users of forced labor camps in China of which the GAP has been implicated.\\n\\n That should not scare you away, just take a minute to figure out where your lines in the sand are; things like no fossil fuel might be a solid one but maybe board diversity doesn't bother you as long as the overall company is doing good work.

However, there are actually quite a few Islamic funds out there; getting a decent advisor, or even better one who specializes in religious thematic investing will probably be able to get you going assuming you are a legal resident of the country you are in. \\nTwo things I would add, unless you are going to give yourself a serious crash course in analyzing a company and public investing I would get someone else to do it for you. The chances that you 1) make a bad bet and loose big are pretty good and/or 2) pick a company that looks fine on the surface only to find they somehow affiliate with something or one who is  counter your religious beliefs. \\nThe other thing is that unless you have a LOT of money to invest and live very simply the chances that at 35 you will be able to live off of your investments alone is pretty low. The general rule is if you can live off of roughly 4% of the money you have invested you can likely live off the interest forever. For example if you had £150,000 to invest you could potentially make around £60,000 in interest which after taxes works out to be roughly 40,000 in take home (assuming a steady 4% return a year which cannot be guaranteed). \\nI don't want to throw cold water on your thoughts but it sounds like finding a good financial advisor (perhaps through you mosque or religious connections) who understands your religious needs around wealth would be a good place to start. That way you can work together to build your wealth in a way that aligns with your beliefs. There are ones that charge a fee per service or ones that have you on a commission or flat fee. Depends on your needs. \\nGood luck!\",\n",

My loose, unstructured thoughts below\\n\\n* ESG is a spectrum, as you mentioned. There are generally agreed upon restrictions for ESG investing, such as investing in landmine producing companies - but the lines become quite blurred dependent upon the house view, external agency view and the client view. For example: would you invest in a company that generates 33% of its revenue from increasing education access for minorities or in deprived areas; but the other 66% is made up of revenue from training fighter pilots and corporate media-training? How do you rate this company on a scale? How does the client view this company?\\n* There have been studies on the effectiveness of ESG - namely that higher scores on an ESG scale tend to be stocks that perform well. I largely think that this analysis is driven by the “G” - if you invest in companies with crappy governance, you may experience the stock blowing up due to some unfortunate “G” disaster. Lately, you are seeing excess returns derived from higher “E” as the cost of renewables has decreased over the last decade, a trend which should hopefully continue. The “S” is the hardest, and most blurred - I would say that this type of investing (i.e. having a predefined outcome when you enter) as it doesn’t always increase the price of the stock; adding extra females to the board, hiring more diverse talent, donating profits etc. are all brilliant initiatives that pay off in the long run but do little to move the price over a medium term.\\n* As with clients, I think it is better to ask what you believe in first - this creates an ideal benchmark.

In that vein, maybe there\\'s a [better way](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/how-financial-innovation-can-save-the-world/257920/) to frame the usefulness of impact investing:\\n\\n>There\\'s a fine line between the \"breathless maximizers\" who champion private impact investment as the cure for all global ills and the \"derisive minimizers\" who dismiss the whole opportunity, Elizabeth Littlefield, OPIC\\'s chief executive, said at the Global Philanthropy Forum in April. The appropriate comparison for impact investing, she said, is not to the entire global capital market, but to the pittance that now goes to foreign aid and economic development. A one percent shift in asset allocation toward sustainable development would generate $2 trillion, she said, 10-times the global budget for foreign aid\\n\\n...and avoid getting defense about it as some kind of challenge to capitalism as we know it...\\n\\n>\"It\\'s not just new money. It\\'s new money tied to newer, more efficient, more innovative generations of technology and infrastructure and services,\" Littlefield said. \"I don\\'t want to bury modern capitalism. I want to cultivate it.\"',\n",

Most of the research I've seen concludes that socially responsible investing results in less diversified portfolios, and (at *absolute best*) similar investment returns, meaning lower risk adjusted returns (you took more risk due to your lower level of diversification).  However, since SRI funds tend to require more active management (security selection and vetting) even for custom SRI index funds, a more likely eventuality is that higher fees result in lower investment returns over time.  This is also assuming that there are no periods in which low SRI stocks outperform and, so long as there is demand for commodities and products such as military hardware, alcohol and cigarettes, this thesis appears extremely unlikely.  [Larry Swedroe, whom I admire greatly, has a succinct piece where he goes over a recent study of the results of SRI funds](http://mutualfunds.com/news/2016/02/09/does-ethical-based-investing-impact-returns/), which effectively demonstrates that investors in those funds may receive a behavioural social benefit (the good feeling they get when they know that they are investing 'responsibly') but at a cost of lower investment returns.  Perhaps this is because sin companies are priced more like value stocks, while socially responsible darlings are bid up by investors seeking social benefits rather than economic ones?\\n\\nIn principle, if you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, SRI can never have any impact on the capital market.  At some point, even if it did influence the price of securities, the most it could do would be to effect a transfer of risk-free return between active market participants (with the socially responsible investor being the loser in this arrangement).\\n\\nGenerally, the prevailing wisdom is to ignore investment buzzwords and fads.  Invest in simple, timeless products like cap weighted, total market index funds (warts and all).  If you are concerned with social, economic or environmental issues affecting our planet and society (and you should be; empathy for others is an admirable human characteristic), your cause is likely to be best served by donating a portion of your investment profits to the registered charity of your choice, rather than giving it to fund companies in fees or hedge fund managers in excess returns.\",\n",

       "              'Union Square Ventures\\n\\nUSV 2021 Fund\\nAndy Weissman\\nAndy Weissman – Jan 26, 2021\\n\\nWe are pleased to announce that USV has raised a 2021 Core Fund with commitments of $250 million. This Core Fund will complement our new Climate Fund and existing Opportunity Fund. This will be USV’s seventh early-stage venture fund since the firm was founded in 2003. \\n\\nAs before, we continue to invest with a thesis-driven approach, the USV Thesis 3.0: \\n\\nTrusted brands that broaden access to knowledge, capital, and well-being by leveraging networks, platforms, and protocols\\n\\nWe believe this thesis is as relevant today as when we articulated it in April 2018.\\n\\nThis past year has seen fundamental (and likely permanent) behavioral changes such as the growth in distance learning, increased usage of telemedicine and asynchronous digital health delivery, and the rise of remote work. These changes accelerated digitalization of tech stacks that in other industries have often been a precursor to falling costs and wider access (e.g., ecommerce). These are the types of opportunities we have been focused on since the beginning of Thesis 3.0. \\n\\nWe are particularly interested in understanding companies that are finding ways to broaden access to learning and healthcare by creating new, trusted solutions. For example, education is largely taught the same way today as it has been historically – a physical arena where people join for classes. Medical care as well –  big changes in 2020 notwithstanding. What are the ways to make people – learners and patients – the center of these markets? We aim to find not only the direct application of these solutions, but also those that serve the solutions.\\n\\nCompanies we’ve invested in like Duolingo, Outschool, Quizlet, Codecademy, Sora Schools and Skillshare broaden access to knowledge; Nurx, Brave Health, and Modern Fertility broaden access to wellbeing. These are good guideposts which we will continue to focus on: either direct to learner/patient or an enabling layer to fuel the direct to learner/patient market. We also look to expand the definition of what this means – for example, we are particularly interested in mental health companies that may not look like healthcare businesses at all.\\n\\nAccess to knowledge means education but also tools and platforms that support how knowledge is shared and remembered in organizations or groups, including in this new, more remote world.\\n\\nWellbeing to us includes healthcare but also community and fun. New delivery mediums (such as audio) present ways to bring high-density kinds of information to more people for entertainment, healthcare, learning or other purposes. This includes companies like Abridge, Headgum, Wattpad and Meet Cute. Here we also look for new tools and technology-enabled production methodologies.\\n\\nSimilarly, access to capital remains concentrated. Companies like Possible, Stash, Teamshares and Noah broaden services to more people, on better terms through innovations in business models, underlying infrastructure, or new ways of reaching the customer. We also continue to look for ideas that center on collaborative solutions to capital problems – multiplayer fintech, if you will. \\n\\nAs in our last several funds, we expect a significant portion of the investments -around 30%- will be crypto-related investments. This will include holding tokens directly as well as equity in early-stage blockchain-related projects. Crypto networks embody both the evolution of trust in computing and financial systems, as well as vastly expanded access, so we view crypto networks as completely aligned with Thesis 3.0. We believe the opportunity to decentralize systems is still in early stages, seeing adoption tailwinds, and with a lot of interesting new activity.\\n\\nAs always, we remain committed to our way of practicing venture capital and finding those companies that believe we can be great partners. Our funds are small. Our focus is thesis-driven. Our website is a compilation of ideas from ourselves and others, constantly evolving yet always open and public. We publish our investment memos as blog posts. We are active partners to all the companies we invest in at all times. And our decision making is collaborative (we don’t vote).\\xa0\\n\\nThank you to our investors for their continued trust.',\n",

The big players know how important this technology is but also know that they need to pick the right one, which takes a lot of time.

I would add for any skeptic on the bull uranium thesis, the lead time to building a mine can range, from the DFS to actual first ore mined, between 2 years to 6 years depending on factors such as open-pit versus underground, infrastructure access, ISR versus traditional mining. Even if we assume all mine restart now, the ones in care and maintenance, and even add BHP's Olympic dam expansion, we will arrive in 2028, the year at which cigar lake will end production, with a massive deficit in supply. To put it another way, we would have needed mines to start building new advanced stage deposits in the last 2 years in order to satisfy what looks like, in the most likely scenario, a real deficit of roughly 20 to 30 M lbs a year by 2024. Every year that goes by where projects that could start are being delayed, we further stretch the elastic in the direction of a quick rise in sport and term market price. Whilst this news might be disappointing for short-term traders in the space, rest assured that every year that goes by without seeing a rise in market price and long-term contracting activity increases the length and the depth of the rally that will see in the future.\",\n",

But on the supply side, I agree that it doesn’t make immediate sense for Kazatomprom to ramp up production, but would this not essentially be good long term business for them if it means it becomes quite literally unaffordable for others (competitors) to come into the supply picture. I take the point that it wouldn’t wholly fill the supply gap over the next decade, but we’re talking about this bull run as a relatively short term entity. And I think you might be underestimating the significance of this on the bull run, the case for which is predicated predominantly on supply dynamics.

       "              'You made money because you bought stocks at the bottom, and then bought in at the moment that retail investors become powerful in big enough numbers and invested the same way spiking stocks that catch a bid from amateur investors. In numbers is strength. The problem is people need the exit eventually - dividends or sale. The first won’t happen in many of these, the second requires you exit before others do if there isn’t an institutional bid to take it. Look at what happened with marijuana stocks a couple years ago to see what happens when fast retail money is the investor base. Losses over 90% in some cases. \\n\\nA good number of the stocks you went into are really flawed companies that either won’t exist or will have far lower valuations in 5 years. Some are very good and well timed companies - fb and arguably Tesla (valuation) as well as disney. But many of your picks would’ve been a disaster in any other matket - this one is really unique, unlike anything that’s been seen since the late 90s and late 20s, which were the last times fast retail or retail-like money dominated.  \\n\\nJinko solar as an example had a good break but has no advantages, and is a commodity producer. It also might get delisted in a year or two because of new us rules. Solar in general is a horrible industry because it’s commodity and because China created oversupply with national industrial policy eliminating the benefit of producing more efficiently - since they’ll dump product at or below cost in some cases. I know less about first solar but pretty sure most of the value is in install which is a local contractor business. Just because something is good for society doesn’t mean the industry will be profitable. Solar hasn’t been. \\n\\nWind is just a narrow not great business. Specific wind companies may be but most of our future green energy is going to be solar, or fusion if we crack that. \\n\\nWKHS has a head start but lacks tech advantages. Tesla is the only credible ev company, so all of the possible ev companies get a huge bid. But most are bad companies that will get out competed by either Tesla or an existing large, well run auto company like Toyota or Ford. \\n\\nRare earths are also a horrible business. It’s a global commodity. China over supplies it under national industrial policy and to get some control so everyone is now building out capacity for national strategic reasons then government will make purchases to make it survive. But you’ll have a massively oversupplied commodity market which means zero or negative profits. Only up because of the retail bid. \\n\\nCommon theme of a lot of your smaller green stocks is you bought stuff for which there will be revenue and a future need, but industry dynamics with the company’s strategy prevent strong profitability. \\n\\nSome of your best purchases you got pretty late and show very small returns. SHOP is up 1500% for a lot of people. Chasing a gain on a stock up 1500% in the past year can work but is aggressive. \\n\\nAnyway congrats on the gains but you need to not view these as your investing rules. This year is unlike any other and a lot of your positions stand on greater fools not selling. I would be particularly wary of any company that has been $1b of market cap or less in past 2 years and is up 5x or more in the past year, especially if it is a chinese adr or is a former penny stock. Id also be skeptical of industries that lack profitability. A lot of yours are checking most of those boxes.\\n\\nYou said it yourself, this works because you are buying your beliefs. A lot of new retail money is doing that and that makes this profitable now - if everyone buys it goes up. But investing works in the long run because the companies make a lot of money and/or persistently attract capital from major allocators. Many on this list will do neither.',\n",

Educating yourself and creating a stream of income is much more important at this stage in your life. A solid income will allow you to buy more stocks. With some extremely rare exceptions, people who spend their time creating streams of income or improving their primary stream (job/business) and buy more stocks will come out ahead of people who spend all their time trying to pick the perfect stocks. This is not common knowledge (do some reading and reflecting), but not even Warren Buffet made his money by picking the right stocks.\\n\\nAll this being said, take my advice with a grain of salt. I'm only 23 and still have a fuck ton more to learn about the world, but I have been at this just a little longer and (simply because we are at such a developmental stage in our lives) have had many more life experiences than you. \\n\\nOnce again, stay humble.

If you’re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there.\\n\\nCongratulations on your results, and on your willingness to share your though process. My main concern is with your idea that \"traditional metrics\" are irrelevant for Tesla. Presumably you are talking about value metrics such as PE and PEG , book value, and such which can be used as a means of finding the intrinsic value of the company. \\n\\nIt\\'s true that it\\'s very hard to value a company during hyper-growth, so those metrics become somewhat meaningless because you don\\'t know what the real P/E is if you don\\'t know what the earnings are actually going to be in the future.\\n\\nWhen you buy a business for long term hold (as opposed to short term speculation that someone else will pay more for it than you paid), the \"traditional metrics\" are the only thing you would care about, because that\\'s how you can judge whether you will make back enough money to make it worth your investment. How much would you pay for, say, a local plumbing company or gas stations that earns $250,000 per year? Would 1,000x earnings be reasonable? If so, I will happily sell you such a business for $250M bucks. That\\'s what you\\'re paying for TSLA today, on hopes that they will make LOTS more than they do today.\\n\\nBut one thing is for sure, unless TSLA in the near future earns many multiples of what it earns now, the price is going to get crushed. If the hyper-growth slows down the price will be hammered. It won\\'t be a \"dip\" or a \"correction\", it will be a permanent loss of capital for TSLA speculators. \\n\\nFor you it will be no big deal, since you are not gambling your rent money. But when this bubble pops, a lot of people who have speculated way too much money that they should not be putting at risk, will get crushed. \\n\\nBeing a long term holder won\\'t save you. In order for the value of the company to match the current prices and recover, will take decades of successful business growth. AMZN peaked at ~$86 in Dec \\'99 and didn\\'t see those levels again until 2009. And AMZN is the most successful of the post- Dotcom bubble companies.',\n",

Volumes for futures and options contracts have more than doubled since 2015, ICE said in a statement Monday. The trades will continue to be cleared through ICE’s London business.\\n> \\n> The shift comes after the Brexit transition period ended on Dec. 31, cutting off access to most London trading from the bloc and jolting several major markets. European equities have moved to Amsterdam and Paris from London, while some derivatives contracts have shifted out of Europe altogether in favor of Wall Street platforms.\\n> \\n> The development is a setback for the U.K.’s government’s bid to become a center for sustainable finance. In his vision for financial services after Brexit, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has said he wants the U.K. to be a “world leader in the use of green finance,” and that Britain is preparing to issue its first green gilts.\\n> \\n> Read more on the U.K.’s plans for green finance\\n> \\n> At issue for the carbon market is the lack of an “equivalence” decisions from the EU that would have made it cheaper and easier for traders to continue dealing in London. Lobby groups for energy firms pressed Brussels at the end of last year to take urgent action to resolve the matter, arguing they would face a “stark choice” of paying more in collateral to do business in London or else restrict their ability to manage risks.\\n> \\n> While EU and U.K. policy makers are discussing how to cooperate on financial services going forward, Brussels has signaled it’s in no rush to grant broad access to London through equivalence decisions. The realities of leaving the EU have “come home to roost” for Britain, Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial services commissioner, said on Bloomberg TV last month.\\n> \\n> The U.K. is launching its own emissions trading system to cover polluters now that it’s out of the EU. Nominally launched at the beginning of this year, ICE is set to begin auctions by the second quarter, along with the trading of futures contracts.\\n> \\n> There is an expectation in the market that the U.K. and EU could link the two systems so that permits in one could be used in the other, boosting liquidity.',\n",

I'm happy to talk, if you'd like.\\n\\nAs far as what I did, it was mostly Google like crazy and cry, tbh. I also found TFMR online groups on Baby Center and WTE, and it was very helpful (albeit heartbreaking) to hear others' stories. I totally understand you wanting it all to just be over, I was the same. We had a (very) abnormal NT scan at 12 weeks, followed by a NIPT and CVS at the MFM (their scan confirmed that the NT/cystic hygroma was very large and getting worse). For us, having each test come back with consistent results helped, in a way. It was the hardest decision we've ever had to make, but being certain about the diagnosis made us feel more sure in our decision to terminate at almost 16 weeks.\\n\\nCould you call the department that will do the termination and start to set up an appointment? It can always be cancelled or moved based on your results, but at least then you'd know. I had to go to a totally different practice for it, but the nurse was unbelievably patient and compassionate (I definitely ugly-cried on the phone every time I spoke to her). They can also tell you any changes or restrictions that may occur due to timing and answer questions. Don't feel guilty for considering a TFMR before your results come in. The reality is that there's a time sensitivity and medical offices are busy. Like I said, setting an appointment is not definitive, it can always be cancelled.\",\n",

It sounds from your other posts that you are in America. I'm in Britain so things may be different. Out 12 week scan showed increased nucal thickening which led to the blood test same as you with 85% result. I then had the CVS a two weeks after that result as they wanted the baby to grow a bit more. We absolutely had to be sure before making any decisions about TFMR and my doctor in the fetal medical unit described the CVS as the 'gold standard' test. We saw it as an essential factor in helping us make a decision. I will be honest that it was an unpleasant procedure and I found it emotionally very traumatic but also very necessary. The CVS was Friday and we had the results by the following Wednesday. I was then back in the next Wednesday for the TFMR. I'm not sure how they do it in the States, but at my local women's hospital you are induced and give birth to the baby so do find out what the procedure would be like if you choose to go down that route. I was 16weeks+1day when we lost our boy. I coped in those 4 weeks of worry by working. I had to carry on and I refused to Google - which I see lots have people have said they did. I didn't want false hope and I also didn't want no hope. I stayed busy. Cried a lot and didn't do a lot to sleeping. I know due to Covid you might not be able to do that. But above all else, talk. Do not hold it in. We lost our boy on the 4th December and I was due this coming 18th May. I am still working through it and it hasn't been easy.

If we had known ahead of time, I would have strongly wanted to consider aborting, and I probably would have been in favor of it. My wife absolutely would not have done it, though, so it\\'s a moot question.\\n\\nEleven years later, I can tell you that there\\'s no way I\\'d give up my daughter, I don\\'t wish that we hadn\\'t had her, nothing like that. She\\'s awesome, and I love having her. But my love for and attachment to her is completely post-birth -- she\\'s now a living, breathing, person to me, so I can no longer imagine my world without her.\\n\\nHowever, if I didn\\'t know her, was back 12 years ago and told that the baby is going to have Down? Yep, I\\'d still strongly consider aborting.\\n\\nThat\\'s the background and context. Here\\'s my advice:\\n\\nFirst, it\\'s a decision for you and your wife.  Anyone who tells you that they know the \"right\" answer, whether it\\'s by religion, experience, knowledge of society, whatever -- they\\'re wrong. The decision belongs to you two.\\n\\nSecond, a negative: you\\'re going to hear plenty of people talk about how \"Down Syndrome made our lives better. We\\'re so blessed with this gift. Blah blah blah.\" I\\'m happy that those people feel that way. If that\\'s part of their paradigm, great. It doesn\\'t work for me. IMO, it\\'s not a fucking gift. My daughter is great. The Down Syndrome sucks. It brings health threats, stress that you don\\'t have with non-DS kids, bullying from the shitty people in society, and more. Having a child with Down Syndrome is NOT just like having any other child, no matter how people like to dismiss it as such.\\n\\nThird, a positive: IMO, there is still a lot of truth to the \"every child is different anyway\" philosophy, and the differences that come with Down Syndrome sometimes do actually cause positives. In my case, I\\'ve become far more patient with (most) people, because I\\'ve had to learn to be so much more patient with my daughter. I\\'m also convinced that having a special needs child facilitates us meeting some of the best people in the world, whom we might not have encountered otherwise.\\n\\nSome things to expect: you can expect to have as many positive and happy moments as you would have with any other child -- expect to closely examine and possibly adjust your expectations to make sure you don\\'t miss these. Expect to plan, and most likely to stress a bit or a lot; you\\'ll need to figure out how your child will be cared for when you\\'re no longer capable of providing care. Expect to learn a lot about working with schools and other organizations who might need to accommodate your child\\'s needs -- some of these will embrace your situation, others will be outright antagonistic, and you\\'ll have to figure out how to navigate them. Expect additional stress between you and your wife when Down brings you a truly trying moment, and plan ahead for how you two will cope together when it happens. There\\'s a reason the divorce rate of parents in the special needs community is so much higher than in the rest of society. \\n\\nI know it sounds like I\\'m calling out all the negatives, but face it -- most of the differences brought by DS are negatives. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t handle them in a happy, healthy, positive way. It just means that DS brings you a high chance of heart perforations and mental retardation; it never brings you super immunity and an invitation from MENSA. The key, IMO, is to be sure that you can make a happy family life with the successes your child will have -- life will still be wonderful, it\\'ll just likely be a wonderful different from what you pictured when you thought about having a child.',\n",

But when we got our diagnosis (about the same time as you), termination suddenly seemed like a serious option.  I felt so much shame for considering termination, but at the same time, I knew there was no way to bring my child into the world unless my wife and I were fully on board.  We spent several nights just crying on the couch together.  Even without making a decision, we were in mourning, because we had lost the child that we were expecting to bring into this world. We stopped telling people about the pregnancy, because if we decided to terminate, we didn't want our friends to know about it.  \\n\\nA few weeks passed, and the day came where the doctor asked us if we wanted to get an amniocentesis to confirm the diagnosis.  An amnio, as you will find out, has very high accuracy but also a very small chance of causing a miscarriage.  We decided that we didn't need confirmation, because we were going to keep the baby no matter what.  Looking back, I think that is when the healing truly started to begin.  By the time our daughter was born, we were not only ready, we were excited. \\n\\nThere is no easy path to get to this decision, and nobody--not me, or your family, or anyone else--can tell you what decision to make.  Take your time.  Allow your hearts and minds to slow down a little.  Nothing but time will heal the hurt that you are feeling right now.  You are mourning, and mourning has to run its course.  Either you are mourning the loss of another child, or you are mourning that your child won't have the life that you dreamed for him or her.   \\n\\nBut that said, once the mourning has run its course, there is joy on the other end like you could never imagine.  Although I am glad that I allowed myself to seriously consider termination as an option, not a day goes by that I don't thank God that we decided to keep our daughter.  She is without a doubt the best thing to ever happen to me, and the light of my life.  She has so much joy, and even though she takes longer than her peers to do certain things, she loves life to the fullest and enriches those around her.\\n\\nDon't do it right away, as it will be too much to process, but in the coming weeks, find a down syndrome support group in your area and connect with other families.

We didn\\'t know how our daughter would be until she was born.\\n\\nI love my daughter intensely and could not imagine my life without her in it.  It would devastate me if we lost her.  That said, I have wondered what would have happened if my wife had have been against the idea of having a disabled child.  I suspect I would have gone along with whatever she wanted, as I didn\\'t feel strongly either way at that time.  Had we aborted, who knows, we might have gone on to have a \"normal\" child.  We might not have successfully conceived again.  We\\'ll never know.\\n\\nI suppose the point in making is: whichever way you go with it, in the end it will all turn out alright.  If you have a kid with DS, you will fall in love with them and cherish them, even though they are a bigger commitment and are harder work.  If you abort, you will probably rationalise that decision in the years to come and consider it to have been the right choice for you.  I don\\'t think you will make the wrong choice either way, so long as it is the choice you BOTH want.  ',\n",

At least not until every single special needs kiddo sitting in foster care waiting for a home, HAS ONE. The plain truth of the matter is that some people should not be parents, and some other people should not be special needs parents, and if you fall into either category, better that you admit it than that a child suffer. We had the life experience to be pretty sure we could handle it, and we were right, we are glad we continued the pregnancy. But we don\\'t make that assumption for others.\\n\\nI will say that parenthood, whether special needs or not, brings out qualities you never knew you had.

       "              'I have a bit of a non-conventional view about abortion.  For myself, I am pro-life.  But for the rest of the world, I am pro choice.  \\n\\nI found out about my daughters diagnosis after she was born.  So I never had to grapple with what you and your wife are going through right now. I do know I would have kept my daughter either way.  But that’s because I am me.  You are you.  Your life and family dynamic and personalities and finances are different than mine.  There is no right answer.  Which makes this kind of diagnosis much harder.  \\n\\nThe fact is, not everyone is capable of being a parent to a disabled child.  Down syndrome is pretty mild compared to some of the other diagnosis out there.  But it does still come with additional and specific hardships and trials.  I have seen several parents who because they accepted something they couldn’t handle, have destroyed their lives and lead to their disabled child being forced to live a life of abuse and neglect.  Not being able to handle a disabled child does not make you a bad person.  But accepting one and then not meeting their needs and the responsibilities you accepted, does.\\n\\nBefore my daughter, the idea of being a parent to a disabled child wasn’t ever something I thought I wanted.  I had no real interactions with those with either physical or mental disabilities, except for a few instances.  I did t believe I was capable of it.  So when my daughter was born and we learned of her diagnosis, i was shattered.  I was so scared.  I felt so inadequate.  I felt so guilty of wanting my daughter to be something she wasn’t.  I mourned the daughter I thought I was having.  I was so overwhelmed by what I didn’t know, by what I thought my life would be like.  It was like my life stopped, and now all of a sudden I was living a life I never planned on or wanted. \\n\\nWhat I wish I could show you now, what I wish I had know when I was going through what you are, is how normal my life is.  How normal my daughters life is.  Yes, there are more doctors visits, and specialists.  There are different teachers, and different milestones met in different ways.  But so much of our everyday life is exactly the same as everyone else’s.  My daughter does have DS, but it’s such a small part of who she is.  She is still the little girl I carried and wanted.  She is exactly who she was supposed to be.  She just had a surprise we didn’t know about.  I truly love my daughter.  Not in spite of her DS, but because of who she is, because of everything she is.  She is smart, and cute, and funny, and sweet.  She loves her older sister and her cats.  She loves to help cook, and to color, and read.  She loves dancing and singing.  She loves playing with her baby dolls.  She fights with me and her sister, just like other kids.  She will refuse to wear pants, just like other kids.  She will sneak into the hidden candy stash and try and get out of being in trouble, just like other kids.  She goes to school. She has friends.  She goes swimming. She loves play grounds and museums.  \\n\\nWhile I don’t think being a parent to a disabled child is for everyone, I also don’t think that it’s something only special people can do.  I’m not really any different than other parents.  I’m not specially gifted for the difficulties that my daughter brings with her.  I’m constantly learning and messing up, just like every other parent in the world.  But there are things that I do believe I would never have learned or gained because of my daughter.  The person I am today, is someone I am very proud to be.  And I owe a lot of that to my daughter.\\n\\nI’m so sorry for what you are going through.  I wish there was something I could say that made this easier for you.  But what I want you to know, is that there isn’t a wrong decision.  Just the right decision for you and your family.  And if that decision is keeping the pregnancy, you will have a whole community of people in real life and on line who will be there to support you.  ',\n",

I thought no matter what it’s my child I would deal with the challenges. My partner didn’t want the baby as he thought he would be unable to cope. We spoke about it and decided that we would give it a go.  I cried for a bout two weeks straight until I finally thought it’s my baby this should be the happiest moment of my life. People avoided the subject as they didn’t know how to approach it and I kind of thought to myself maybe they got it wrong. But at birth he was taken away as he wasn’t breathing properly and I wasn’t able to see him for a few hours. And that not knowing told me o would love him no matter what. He was diagnosed when he was a day old. Fortunately he has no sight, hearing or heart problems. I thought my family and friends wouldn’t accept him as he was disabled and boy was I wrong the amount of love shown to him is overwhelming. It has been a struggle but if I could go back and change it for myself I would not. He is amazing. It’s ok to feel like your unlucky in this situation, it’s normal to want everything to be perfect.

I don't say this to be rude. I know and understand why a lot of people would find this to be a hard decision. Still, I think it's important to explain that it would be a very easy decision for many people. Hard decisions are where the choices seems to have pros and cons that balance each other and are difficult to weigh: vanilla vs. chocolate would be a harder decision for many people.  \\n\\n\\nImagine that you think  without a religious viewpoint (e.g. thinking that a child is a gift from God). Now, imagine that birth control failed and you had to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy. If you were going to postpone having a child for another year or two, it might be a difficult decision: maybe we should have this one. But, if you were absolutely certain that you did not want a child, the decision is a simple one: have an abortion.   \\n\\n\\nYou need to ask yourself the most important question: why are we having a child? You made a decision to have a child...why? In essence, children are great values to us parent... they bring so much joy in so many ways. One of the ways in which they do this is that we get to help them grow up, we get a chance to give them our values, and see them grow into certain types of adults. If this is part of your motivation, then there is a point at which a kid with significant living disabilities is not going to fulfill your core reasons for having a child in the first place.   \\nThese days, there is so much technology and other support, so one can fulfill one's reasons even if one has a kid with disabilities that would have been debilitating a generation ago: but there's a limit.  \\n\\n\\nOf course if you have a kid and they meet with some catastrophe, you will do all you can to support them. But, this is not a living, breathing person yet. Really, only a religious or similarly mystical view can equate a baby at 20 or so weeks with a  full human person.   \\n\\n\\nAnother important aspect about having kids is that they come with a cost: all kids do. Nobody can ever prepare you enough for how much your life changes when you have kids. So much of your world starts to revolve around their needs, goals, schedules. This is increasingly true as families are smaller and neighbors are more distant. When you decide to have a kid, you with the values against these costs. With a kid who has significant disabilities, these costs (not talking money... mostly, mental focus, and also time)... go up. At some point, they bog you down.  \\n\\n\\nCan you get through it? Sure, so many people do? if you have the kid, will you love it and be happy that you had it, and tremble at the thought that you contemplated abortion: almost certainly...once you have a living, breathing -- most importantly, interacting -- human child, you will be a great parent and enjoy your parenting.  \\n\\n\\nBut, you would lie to yourself if you thought these were the costs and benefits that you signed up for when you decided to have a kid. Sometimes nature messes up. It's part of life, but you don't have to resign yourself to it anymore than you would resign yourself to some other tragedy for which you have an easy solution.\",\n",

We did a ton of research and talked to everyone we could (doctors, staff from Down Syndrome clinics, etc.). \\n\\nWe knew that we could have made it work but when we looked at other families and found one that could do it better we made our choice so that he would have the best chance at a good life. Our child is with a family whose first choice was a child with Down Syndrome. He has a sibling who also has Down Syndrome, two parents who work part-time and can both be at every appointment, grandparents who are financially independent and available to help with childcare. These are things we could not have given him. My husband and I also both felt we would not be able to have another child if we would have chosen to parent our son because we didn't feel it was fair to knowingly place the burden of his care after we die on a younger sibling.\\n\\nWe love our baby but given the chance we would have ended the pregnancy.

They have a great sense of humor, and many of them love to dance. There is a spectrum of mental disability there that varies from child to child. Some are verbal, and some aren't but they communicate in other ways (tablet or sign language).\\n\\nI'm not a parent. I only see these kids on special occasions. It's a much different story to be parenting children with this disability. They have special needs and they require more attention than non-DS children. \\n\\nWhat I would recommend to you is to come up with a list of things that you and your wife are willing to commit to, and what is out of the question. Then ask parents of DS children to be very honest and candid about both the good things and the bad things, and see if this is something you are willing to take on. If the answer is 'no', that doesn't make you a bad person, it just means you're being true to yourself and not committing to something that will be way over your head.\\n\\nI think the major question you'll need to answer is, are you willing to commit a lot of time and effort into raising a child, without that common assumption that they'll be able to be independent upon reaching age 18? Only you and your spouse can honestly answer that. \\n\\n(I'm not trying to sound like Negative Nelly, btw. In fact I love volunteering with DS kids. I just think you should answer those serious questions you have now, and do it truthfully. Get answers from the parents who know what it's like. Then make your decision, and move forward with no regrets.)\",\n",

Hopefully she will hear your opinion on it though, as her husband. And hopefully whatever the choice you can move on as a married couple with whatever comes next. You may have religious beliefs that make this more difficult, I don’t know. Right now you see this as a child in the future but right now it is not the same as a full term baby. A 13 week fetus is tiny. There is essentially no brain function, it cannot survive outside the womb. I know to you it’s your child and I respect that, just want to put this in perspective. A termination is a safe and quick procedure and your wife will recover. There’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to try again.\\n\\nThere are pros and cons to both sides. Some women regret terminations. Some parents regret having a child with disabilities. Your child could function at a high level and live a pretty normal life. Or your child could be low functioning and live at home for the rest of their life. The latter costs much much more and not just monetarily. These are things to consider. Can you afford the possibility of putting your child in a facility if he/she needs care you can’t give? Can you handle possibly outliving your child? Can you handle giving up your retirement to care for a disabled, adult child? Potentially working for many more years to make ends meet for everyone? If you have other children what does this mean for them, their time with you and their financial stability? Can your marriage withstand it? Can you handle this alone if your wife were to die for some reason? Can she handle it if you died? These are worst case scenarios but you should prepare for all possibilities. And if you both can handle it no matter what then that’s awesome. But there’s absolutely no shame in saying you can’t and choosing a termination. You can also choose adoption, but going back to your normal life after will be hard. People will know your wife was pregnant and wonder what happened. You most likely will be judged by some. Depending on your state her family or yours could make things difficult. That child will be out there in the world and could find you someday. That’s a hard option too.\\n\\nThis is a terrible decision to have to make. You’re in my thoughts. \\n\\n',\n",

I received another patients positive results and they received my clean screen. (IN)**\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal Post: \\r\\n\\r\\n> Yesterday, when I went to the clinic to get my dose, I was told there was a hold on my account and needed to see my counselor. Apparently, my DT from last week came back positive for opiate & fentanyl. This is 100% impossible and my counselor said there’s a new lab tech, and that it’s possible they switched my label with someone elses. He also said this wouldn’t be the first time Its happened.\\n> He even had a patient in mind that it could have been switched with, because we tested around the same time and their screen came back negative while he was expecting it to be positive. \\n> He told me I can pay $40 to have the sample investigated further, to see exactly what percent and substance was in the urine; but I informed him I didn’t want to pay that for someone else’s results. If I were to do that, I would have a new test done and also pay to have that sample reviewed, to cross reference both results. \\n> I also asked if he could cross reference the results of everyone who took a test the same time as me, and he told me he would do that, as well as speak to his supervisor about how to go about fixing this. He does believe the results were wrong, and seems to be working on my side, but he’s also being slightly nonchalant about it. Where as I’m freaking out, this is a huge mistake for someone to make, and I do not want my record to reflect someone else’s results. \\n> After meeting with my counselor yesterday he put me down for another drug test that day, which I went to do but was informed the lady left early, I then told my counselor this and he said I could take it this morning.

I’ve kept my counselors informed about what’s going on with me and work with them, I’m very dedicated to my sobriety. \\n> \\n> I asked him if the positive screen had thc in it as well, thinking that would be a dead giveaway if it didn’t, but unfortunately it did. That is why I made the comment about paying for both the old and new screen to be reviewed further, to check the amount of thc in each to see if it could prove it’s not mine, since my level would have been extremely low on last weeks result, and more than likely non-existent in this new test (that I will hopefully take tomorrow)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\nLocationBot 4.999988713 83/601rds  | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) | >!TdUO5NmMWlXWXJFcjJzZ!<',\n",

As you say, the two are complimentary, not redundant. I'm 34,  so I'm not exactly young - I'm quite concerned about chromosomal abnormalities, but the fact that the NIPT does not screen for other kinds of abnormalities really concerns me. I did only NIPT with my first child and was sweating out until the anatomy scan. This time I'm opting for the NT. I'll just have to hope it's accurate enough for the chromosomal abnormalities. It really bothers me though. I actually have a PhD in plant biology and deal with WGS and SNP data on a daily basis in my day job, so I'm more adept than the average patient for understanding the methodologies, their respective strengths and weaknesses, and interpreting the data appropriately. \\n\\nI hate this.

The fact that your second test is fully negative is reassuring. The only way for you to be positive is to either be one of those rare infection cases on prep or acute infection of hiv1 or very early infection of hiv 2.

My regular OB said that she had patients who tested positive on amnio but the baby at birth tested negative which really confused me - my high risk today said that wasn’t the case and that amnio is fool proof 100%. Just really overwhelming to decide to take the extra risk. My doctor today did say I could go for an echo to rule out heart issues to ease my mind as it’s not invasive, so I’m also leaning to do that too. Too many options and things to decide 😫',\n",

Unfortunately our cord blood clotted after they took it (10 pm birth) so they had a NICU nurse come and do an arterial blood draw which was so easy and no big deal. I actually wish I'd opted for delayed cord clamping instead of the cord blood draw, so that's something to consider if you give birth at night - the blood they collect may clot before they can send it off in the morning. \\n\\nLike you we had no signs on amnio, except that past 32ish weeks her long bones started measuring short. At this point I was convinced she had Mosaic Turner. They didn't think a fetal echo was necessary after a very long and detailed look at the heart twice at my MFM. At birth they sent the blood to the Mayo Clinic for a targeted FISH, the results came back in about a week that she was normal XX. I cried so much on the phone when they told me!\\n\\nThe only choice I regret was getting the NIPT in the first place. I don't regret not getting the amnio. It was terribly stressful waiting, but especially knowing that she has normal chromosomes, I am glad I didn't risk the ammio. She was already an IUD post Covid infection baby, so a bit of a miracle. Our amnio choice would have possibly been different if they had seen abnormalities like CH or heart issues.\",\n",

Solar can only be produced during the day and depends on the weather.  Wind is fairly consistent, but still somewhat weather-dependant and storms and high winds can force turbines to park to avoid damage, cutting power.  Hydro is consistent, but the locations hydro can be built are limited.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve heard a lot of people say that Nuclear is going to replace coal as the stable, consistent energy supplier with reliability other renewables can\\'t reach.\\n\\nOnly problem I have with this idea is that nuclear fuel is expensive.  With coal, if demand is low because of cheap renewables they can just burn less coal and save on costs.  But nuclear fuel is kind of *always* \"burning\".  Even when the control rods are inserted to reduce power, the fuel rods are being expended at the same rate.  Meaning nuclear becomes *super* expensive to run if it has to compete with cheaper renewables.\\n\\nThoughts?',\n",

I've read that most reactors have an expected lifespan of around 40 years and with many having been built in the 80s-90s, this means they are coming up to the end of their life cycles and may go offline. On the flip side, I've also read that the 40 years is a conservative estimate and many of those may stay online well beyond the expected 40 year lifespan.

I\\'m late to the party, I worked my way backwards to this post by naively looking at a CCJ chart without having followed any uranium news for years, and going, \"OMG this massive influx of buying has never been seen in the stock at this rate, and it happens to be right at the breakout point of a 14 year down trend\". The chart data is clear to see, this appears to be the beginning of a new megacycle, but this time the volume is at least 10x the last cycle with a slightly more aggressive institutional buying algorithm. If you are optimistic and naive like I am, you say to yourself  \"10x volume = 10x price target\", which is not true at all. But it\\'s a great signal for years to come. These types of moves are not short term. Think 4-8-12 years',\n",

       "              'Sustainability is a pretty meaningless term that companies like to use to make their products more appealing to the eco-conscious consumer. The best eco-friendly solution would be for fashion companies to shut their doors and only allow for second-hand to be purchased thus reducing and prohibiting any textile waste from being created but we know that\\'s impossible. Capitalism drives companies to sell as much as possible so even if the textiles are being produce in a way that impacts the environment a little less than another technique the sheer volume of goods they\\'re producing and selling will inevitably impact the environment catastrophically. They are just slowing the inevitable, by simply existing they are a detriment to this planet. That being said we all love our luxury goods whether they are real or fake but limiting what you buy is really the only way to stop emissions and save the planet, but if everyone did that it would cause these companies to collapse since they wouldn\\'t move any inventory. This creates a game of convincing the consumer that their purchases will have a lesser impact on the environment and \"greenwash\" their products to make it more friendly for the eco-conscious consumer which makes this sustainability trend meaningless since it is all about selling product and not a real solution to the issue. That being said worker\\'s rights is something that companies have more control over and it is shocking to see how low LVMH ranked but not surprising. When we think about fake luxury fashion we are made to think of terrorism, child labor and drugs but we seldom discuss the abuses that are happening from the luxury houses like LVMH. Since the price is so high we are made to think that they are crafted with the upmost care and workers are treated like royalty but it just shows you how much marketing and fear mongering can sway the opinion of the masses. This issue of sustainability and human rights abuses is an inherent consequence of capitalism that needs to be addressed in all industries not just fashion.',\n",

With the pandemic, there have been many statements made by fashion designers and fashion houses that they will reduce the number of their annual collections. While promising, that remains to be seen. I compare this to the companies posting BLM advocacy but still not hiring POC or not conducting comprehensive checks on their racial biases. Going back to fashion, sustainability is in the eye of the beholder. Is Hermes practicing sustainability by limiting the number of bags they release? Depends on who's asking. How does BoF come up with metrics? Are these metrics the gold standard in the industry? So many questions and factors to consider. But at the end of the day, we the consumers, hold the key to sustainability. We can dictate how much we want these fashion houses to produce and how they should ethically produce their products. We should be cautious in buying the idea that some companies are 'green' while at the same breathe they are part of the fast fashion. We should also hold ourselves accountable for the manner, speed, and amount we consume things.\\n\\nIf there's one thing that the pandemic and idea of sustainability have taught me, it is to clutch my purse tighter and be more mindful of spending my coins. :)\",\n",

Selecting paper over plastic doesn\\'t have much of a beneficial impact, if it even has a  positive impact at all. And yet for a period, consumers acted as if that decision was most important environmental decision that they made in the supermarket.

Walking, biking, and taking mass transit (product category) are all much more important than selecting a Camry versus an Accord (product-level). \\n\\nRecommendations at the product level (e.g., taking Colgate toothpaste over Crest) tend to be sensitive to where the person is living and what environmental impacts they care most about. They\\'re fragile recommendations (e.g., because they rely on assumptions and data they rely on aren\\'t particularly generalizable). And so, professionals in this field end up sending mixed messages to consumers who want to care, but get disheartened when they put effort into doing the right thing, and it turns out that it\\'s not the right thing after all. \\n\\nIt reminds me of the nutrition field, which can\\'t make up it\\'s mind about a lot of different foods, such as eggs.

I work in sustainability, specifically agriculture, and have been working on a theory or belief for a while and wanted your input.\\n\\nIn my experience, there are two main \"camps\" in agriculture. The \"conventional\" group which experiences great yields, uniformity, reliability, etc, but which can have very high inputs and sometimes negative effects on the environment.\\n\\nThe other camp is the \"organics\" type guys. They tend to have much lower yields, but also lower inputs and fewer negative impacts.\\n\\nI have worked in both groups, and noticed a distinct polarization. Those in the organics tend to speak vitriol about conventional growers as if they were monsters, and although they often have their heart in the right place they are usually delusional about the practical chances of replacing conventional production with their style while feeding the ever growing population.\\n\\nThose in the conventional group tend to reject anything that even suggests organics/sustainability outright as if there were nothing to it.\\n\\nSo to conclude my rant, my belief (have grown MILLIONS of vegetable plants in every different system possible) is that we need some sort of hybrid system combining the best of both worlds. Things such as bacterial and fungal symbiosis have been shown to have fantastic benefits even in hydroponic scenarios, and bio-control of pests is becoming even more attractive as pesticide resistance increases. Conversely, some things are conventional for a reason. Many nutrients simply do not become soluble enough for effective drip use, and there are many VERY labor-intensive things required for non-conventional growth (like tilling, filling bags, flushing pipes, etc) which in some cases drive the labor costs so high that it offsets any benefits the system would have.\\n\\nSo, do you think that there should be more co-operation between conventional and organic-sustainable-ecofriendly agriculture?',\n",

       "              'What’s the “right” thing to do is really more about what your goal is. Most people want to build a portfolio that minimizes the amount of risk taken on for a given level of expected returns. The mathematical mechanics of this were articulated in Modern Portfolio Theory and most still follow this. The idea is that creating a diversified portfolio balances out the individual risk associated with any one stock in the portfolio, leaving you mostly exposed to systemic market-wide risk (a good thing). The guidance was then to created a diversified portfolio of 20-30 stocks spanning different sectors, industries, cap sizes, etc.\\n\\nNow with ETFs, you don’t need to do that. You can just buy one broad-market passive index ETF that is within itself diversified.\\n\\nAll of that above is if your goal is to generate returns that track the market. It’s seen as safe and reliable. And since most hedge fund managers / professional stock pickers don’t actually beat the market over a long enough time horizon (studies have shown this), seeking to generate market returns is also seen as the best longterm strategy.\\n\\nHowever, if you think you understand a particular industry, or a particular company, and think there’s a value opportunity — they seem underpriced compared to what you think they should be valued — then by all means go for it. I would only caution against putting all your eggs in one basket, because if that industry hits an unexpected rough spot, you’ve got nothing else in your portfolio to fall back on.\\n\\nIn my case, I have ITOT at the core of my portfolio. It’s a broad market US fund. But I still add specific sectors or companies around it when I see an opportunity. I bought the airline ETF JETS last May because I thought airline stocks were overly penalized by covid — I thought Covid will be over in one to two years and the stocks will come back, and in the meantime the government wouldn’t let a strategic industry fail. That worked out really well. But I didn’t sell my portfolio and put all my money in it. ITOT was still the core, because I wanted that to balance me out in case my hypothesis about airlines was wrong.',\n",

For example, if you yolo all your money onto one stock, that is a lot of risk, but *on average* you would not expect higher returns than the market, because it is not a *priced* risk (what makes something a priced risk is a bit complicated that I wont get into).

The manufacturer is selling their credibility in exchange for ensuring certain processes are followed for reliability, and those excess costs get passed on to the consumer.\\n\\nAs well, most shops are loathe to install customer-provided parts because there\\'s a lot of additional risk in doing so.  For instance, if the drive fails a month later who is responsible for that?  Was it the part that failed, or was it due to shoddy workmanship?  What if the failure isn\\'t explicit and is instead smaller behavior issues? Do enough work with end consumers and you\\'ll know that many people will do whatever they can to save a dime.   \"Here\\'s my new 1TB M.2 SSD that I got from a sketchy Chinese auction site!\" is followed up with the inevitable \"Hey, this thing only storing up to 120GB, you clearly broke it when you installed it and I want my money back!\" which is further time and effort expended in the name of dealing with a customer you voluntarily entered into a business arrangement with - if left unhappy, many customers will turn around and publicly trash your company and cost you further business even if you were explicit in what your workmanship entailed.\\n\\nIt\\'s great if you can find a mom & pop shop that is reliable, but the problem is finding those reliable shops.  Independent retailers all have different ideas on how business should be conducted, and like penny-pinching customers there are penny-pinching businesses as well.  What if they\\'re saving money by not having ESD protection in their shop?  The part failed - was it due to a bad part or their shoddy workmanship?  How do you know they\\'re actually competent at what they do and not just letting their 13 year old nephew do the installation?  What is your recourse if they damage your equipment and deny responsibility?\\n\\nAnd of course their $60 charge for 10 minutes of work seems expensive, but you\\'re not paying just for 10 minutes of work.  You\\'re paying for the rent for the shop to be there day in and day out.  You\\'re paying for the managers who schedule the techs, you\\'re paying for the unemployment insurance, you\\'re paying for the costs of their electricity and water so they can run in a habitable space, you\\'re paying for accounting work to make sure the books are balanced every month, you\\'re paying for the risks the owner started in opening their own shop, and you\\'re paying for the technician to be available when you decide on a Tuesday morning that you want your computer upgraded right then.  The shop has decided it costs a minimum of $60 per customer just to cover their own costs and ensure some profit at the end of the day.\\n\\nIt\\'s all a balancing act of various interests.  If you want a shop that you know is backstopped by a global manufacturer in regards to quality of workmanship, you pay more for that knowledge so they can be trained and certified.  They\\'re not paid to take risks, and the fact that they have to turn away some business to maintain certain standards means that they\\'re going to charge you more for their work as well.  If you want a shop that can save you money, you\\'re still paying to ensure all of their overhead is covered because you\\'re still choosing them as a source of knowledge and expertise that you yourself lack.',\n",

It's also really not hard to get paid from what I have heard firsthand. Not all MLM's are pyramid scheme. That is an uneducated statement. Some people immediately hear MLM and assume the worst. You should actually see what it really is all about. Pretty much every consultant is there to help people. To help them feel their best and look their best.

Losing money isn\\'t something that only happens in social marketing businesses.\\n\\nTwo. \"Buying stock\" isn\\'t a normal or recommended situation. Having products you personally use, for the purposes of actually understanding what you\\'re marketing, and actually getting value yourself, is the normal. All orders are through an online shop... you never sell stock out of your own cabinet. Giving away samples? Sure. But orders are done externally to you, you don\\'t have to float the product. Ever. People order from an online shop, and you receive commission for creating that bridge. It\\'s hands off, for the people who already know what they want.\\n\\nThree. No income is made on the recruitment of consultants alone. Those consultants must sell products themselves, meaning people are purchasing products they enjoy or find value in, for their upline to make any extra income from people below them... people who are also recieving commission.\\n\\nYou guys can have whatever opinions you please.\\n\\nMy truth? My wife made an extra 14,000 dollars in her first 11 months of running an Arbonne side-hustle, with consistent growth.

A long list of people truly enjoy, and get value out of, a myriad of products that they use everyday.... and the only stock we have on hand is stuff that WE use everyday.\\n\\nOh, and all the consultants below her... who are actually doing the work... are paying their bills with the business, and doing it alongside what they were already doing.

       "              'All of this isn\\'t necessary. It would be far less effective than what we have now.\\n\\nYou discuss environmental concerns.  I\\'ll come to those later.  First, let\\'s talk about efficiency. You mention the energy generation industry. Now, the experts in energy are generally people working in that industry already. The energy generation industry will pay the highest wages for such experts. No committee of generalists - no matter how talented - is likely to perform better than the experts already within an industry. In addition, many parts of the energy industry are competitive. Oil extraction, for example, is very competitive. In many developed countries there are markets for electricity which are also competitive. This means that the most competent organizations succeed, and that the best ideas succeed. Let\\'s say that the R&D department of an electricity company comes up with an optimization for it\\'s power stations. If the optimization works then the business they work for will make greater profits. The procedure will then be copied by others. There is no need for any central committee of generalists to be convinced before anything can happen. Different businesses can experiments and takes different paths. Those that make the best decisions will make the most profit.\\n\\nThe markets also respond quickly to changes in conditions. Far quicker than a large organization could. Producers can choose what inputs then use and vary them over time. If the price of an input rises then other inputs can be used as a substitute. Take the electricity pool markets, for example. When there are high winds the price of wind power falls, so more of it is bought. Other electricity producers then decrease their own output. A more long-term example is the car market. Car bodywork can be made of steel, aluminium or glass-fibre. When the price of one material falls it makes that material more attractive to car makers. It doesn\\'t matter to the car makers exactly why the material changes in price. That\\'s a matter for the makers of those materials. Those further up the chain only see the price change. In this way prices signal scarcity. If a price rises it means that the quantity supplied has fallen or that the quantity demanded has risen. In either case it is efficient to reduce the consumption of that good. The price rise encourages that reduction. So, there is no real reason to change from what we have now.\\n\\nThe exception to all this is environment issues. Producers often create emissions which are costs for other people. For example, coal fired power stations produce carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Farmers using fertilizer and pesticides create run-off. Aerosol cans used to create CFC emissions. All of these things are not priced into the cost of the corresponding activities. However, central organization is not the best way to solve this problem. We can preserve the beneficial effects of markets. One way to do this is to tax these emissions. This tax is designed to capture the cost of the activity to other parties. This is why many countries have carbon taxes or systems of credits for pollution (\"cap-and-trade\"). For other pollutants outright bans are more appropriate.',\n",
