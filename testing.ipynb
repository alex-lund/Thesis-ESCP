My qualifications on this subject are:\\n\\n* I'm a random jack-ass on Reddit\\n* I live in oil-country Kansas\\n\\nHere is what I found when googling the issue. From a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/climate/trump-methane-climate-change.html) on the subject:\\n\\n> The E.P.A.’s new methane rule eliminates federal requirements that oil  and gas companies must install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from wells, pipelines and storage sites.   \\n>  \\n>E.P.A. officials say the new, weaker methane rule is needed to free the oil and gas industry from what they call crippling regulations at a moment when companies are suffering from plummeting prices and falling demand driven by a sharp global economic slowdown. The weakening of the rule, however, **has been in the works for more than a year.** \\n\\nLarge oil companies don't want the EPA to roll this back. They've spent a lot of money trumpeting how great they are for switching to natural gas. They also have the advantage of huge R&D departments and production at scale. These devices won't be as much of a burden on them as on smaller companies. I would be for the government producing these devices and passing them out for the same cost per well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Several of the biggest oil and gas companies have called on the Trump  administration to tighten restrictions on methane, not loosen them. **Larger energy companies have invested millions of dollars to promote natural gas** as a cleaner option than coal in the nation’s power plants, because natural gas produces about half as much carbon dioxide when burned. **They fear that unrestricted leaks of methane could undermine that marketing message and hurt demand.**   \\n>  \\n>Gretchen Watkins, the United States chairwoman for Shell, which has  urged the Trump administration to regulate methane emissions, said, “**The negative impacts of methane have been widely acknowledged for years**, so it’s frustrating and disappointing to see the administration go in a different direction.”\",\n",

Good soil fertility = better agriculture outcomes= better carbon sink.\\n\\n\\n2) PROBLEMS IF AGRICULTURE WAS THE ONLY FOOD SOURCE USED (with its current mainstream practices):\\n\\nA) MONOCROPPING\\n\\nDefinition: the planting of only one type of crop\\n\\nReasons against: \\n-reduces soil fertility \\n- leads to run off that pollutes our waters\\n- leads to erosion \\n- requires pesticide use\\n\\nSolution: \\n- polycropping\\n- inter/alley cropping\\n- crop rotation \\n\\n\\nB) PESTICIDE USE\\n\\nReasons against:\\n- only approx. 2% of pesticides make it on to the desired target\\n- the other 98% becomes airborne pollutants or run off\\n- pests develop resistance easily due to short life spans and then require larger doses or a whole new type of pesticide further polluting soils\\n- unintended side effect: kills potential pest predators too\\n\\nSolution: use of plants that fend of pests\\n\\nC) WATER MANAGEMENT \\nNote: With only having 2.5% of the worlds water be fresh water and only 0.5 % be accessible (aka not tied up in glaciers/ permafrost)we need to treat ol’ blue right.\\n\\nProblem: \\n- ground water/aquifer depletion \\n- pollution from fertilizer and pesticide run off leading to eutrophication \\n- desalination is not as environmentally friendly as was hoped (energy wise and the addition of salt back into the ocean—> changes salinity—> changes animals habitats)\\n\\nSolution:\\n- retention ponds\\n- terracing\\n- trees\\n\\nD) TILLING (turning over the soil)\\nNote: when I learned this it was a big surprise to me...\\n\\nProblem:\\n- leads to leeching ( putting the nutrients into soil horizons inaccessible to plants)\\n- soil crusting that leads nutrient run off\\n\\nSolution:\\n-  No till farming ( e.g shallow cultivation)\\n- use of “green litter” \\n\\n\\n\\nTAKE AWAY:  REDUCING CONSUMPTION= GOOD. ENTIRELY REMOVING = DEBATABLE .\\n(Atm moderation is key and pushing for cleaner practices on ALL fronts is necessary for sustainability)\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S not so fun fact: the last time our supply met our demand was in 1970. Yikes.\\n\\nP.p.S some things my prof said we can do on an individual level to help our ecological footprint that aren’t so obvious:\\n\\n- use shampoos/detergent products that don’t contain phosphorus \\n\\n- when planting grass use native species for your region so not as much water is needed to maintain \\n\\n- advocate for “selective cutting” in leiu of clear cutting practices \\n\\n- advocate for minimum living standards/education—> long story short: this helps with population control  \\n\\n- the 3 Rs of water management ( reduce, repair, retrofit)\\n\\n\\nAnyways hope someone found this helpful!

It's a shame because a healthy ecosystem is a mix of things, just like a healthy gut.. it needs fungus and tons of microbes that are ruined with industry.\\n\\nHappened over and over again here in the US.. long before the dust bowl the great western expansion was partly due to ruined agricultural lands than had nearly depleted the top soils in the east. \\n\\nIf you really care about the environment than stop preaching and start learning!! Top soil depletion is a huge problem still.. river pollution from farms still raises the salinity of the rivers downstream over 30 fold.  Never mind the fact that these things could be mitigated by small changes in production like allowing for furloughed strips on the edges of fields or near runoff.. pretty sure that change alone would stop 70% of topsoil loss or something crazy like that but you're too focused on us meat eaters to worry about growing your food properly.\",\n",

We could watch and learn how the beaver does this and make dams much faster, much better, with metal tools to make the job easier, with friends to make it easier, and the fish and frogs and plants would be all the happier than they are with the beaver.\\n\\nBut we don\\'t look at how the beaver makes a dam. we only care about ourselves, and we don\\'t consider nature, and we make the worst dams, we make dams that destroy ecosystems.

We could watch the movement of the wolf and deer, and learn how to mimic that dance. We could note how the wolf heals the rivers and grasslands, and learn to do the same or more. That would be real science. We could understand the ecosystem and help it do what it does. But we think we\\'re so fucking scientific and smart, we ignore all that, observing nothing but our own diseased inventions, and collect data on our factory farms, and decide that animals are bad for the environment.

       "              \"Absolutelly! There are several reasons why this is true. It is a really complex issue, but, as we must understand sustainability, there is no scenario in which we humans bet for a sustained economic growth while making life bearable for the most vulnerable majorities living in our planet.\\n\\nThere is no argue about this fact. And here I'll expose some of the reasons that sustain that statement. I'll try to be thorough:\\n\\nIn these days that we are living and those that will come, we'll have to make the less harmful decisions. As result of the decision that were made in the past and which can't be reversed, we are living in a system that is collapsing. And I highlight that they are not reversible as Climate Change is something that will happen even though we cut drastically our global GHE, and the same can be told about the ecosystemic destruction, the decrease of energy availability and a large etc of factors that define our times. Thinking otherwise is giving to the human being capacities which we don't possess.\\n\\nAnd what are the less harmful decisions? It depends on how we face that question. Non-optimal options that lie ahead are multiple and in different fields, but i'll focus on one related to this post. The ones that are being contemplated are retaking the path of growth or starting policies based on degrowth of energy and material consumption. Which one is the less harmful? There is no doubt about any of those is sub-optimal.\\n\\nIn the scenario in which countries do their climate homework and choose drastic policies sustained in time of degrowth, enhancing local economy and the primary sector while keeping the actual structure of the laboral market, there would be a massive job destruction. Living in a society in which satisfying our necessitoes relies on money, which we can only obtain with jobs, this is obviously not an optimal solution. There are some measures that could soften the impact of this option, like reducing the workday and others related to wealth redistribution ([a pilar of sustainability as the founders of the concept itself stated in the early 70's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth)) - basic income, expropriation, actually distributed taxation -. But we should go even further giving people autonomy and changing the life conditions to make the basic necessities not dependent of the market.\\n\\nIn my opinion, in our highly unequal societies in which we live in we should struggle to put them in march. Most likely, it won't happen nor fast enough neither with the adequate extension. Opposing to them there are very powerful forces. Even though it is true that living more austere lifes and with an harmonic relationship with ecosystems lead to more plenty and happier lifes.\\n\\nSo, let's see what to expect from the other option: retaking the economic growth. This can be achieved throughout two major policy blocks: \\xa0on the one hand, those based in a massive use of fossil fuels and the maximum exploitation of natural resources, the option _business as usual_ (BAU); and on the other hand, those involved in the denominated _Green New Deal_ (GND), which pivots on a massive deployment of renewable energies.\\n\\nThe BAU option is exemplified by the removal of the Environmental Law from Donald Trump, or the Chinese bet for Carbon. All accompanied by a huge amount of money creation which usually ends up in the most contaminating part of the economy. This will lead us to a planet 4-6 Celsius degrees over the actual climate stability, which would mean that major parts of our planet would be impracticable for human life.\\n\\nRunaway Climate Change is our worst choice, it has already produced over 500k deaths, and it will get worse. Without going any further, it is producing the right conditions to pandemic proliferation. Its impacts increase exponentially as the temperature raises, and I think something that we have learned about the covid crisis that we are living is to understand the importance of the exponentially rising curves. We are already living in a time of resource depletion and an early complete disruption of certain ecosystems.\\n\\nGND is not an option either, mainly due to two reasons. In the short term, it would increase the GHE, and in the mid term, the reduction won't be enough. The second reason is that there are not enough materials to carry it out. In addition, there are more arguments about their inability to maintain the current lifestyle and growth, such as the limited power and versatility of renewables. GND is a false optimal solution.\\n\\nTo all this we should add that, even with strong redistributive measures, both options, BAU and GND, involve high suffering of millions of people, because they are based on maintaining the social and territorial gap. It is one of the keys to the functioning of capitalism.\\n\\nThus, in all options, the popular classes are quite likely to suffer. Although in all of them this suffering will depend on the struggles we wage to achieve a greater or lesser redistribution of wealth, the suffering will be inherently unequal in all three ways. While in the option of degrowth what is on the table is the degree of economic hardship that many people endure, betting on growth what we risk, without exaggerating an iota, is life.\\n\\nWhat do I think that our real options are?\\n\\nTo build a postcapitalist economy based on a de-commercialization and de-desalination of our lives. No minimally emancipatory change can be realized without confrontation with the capitalist classes.\\n\\nSome of you will argue that this is something that it is not socially possible. However, this idea is losing strength after the Covid-19 pandemic. These days life has been prioritized, and we have realized what are the essential services to mantain a dignified life: food, health, waste management, care for dependent persons, etc. These essential services fit in with the triad of decreases-localization-primary economy. And all this has come about with a high level of social consensus. What seemed impossible, suddenly, in a few weeks, has become an assumed reality. \\n\\nHowever, economic and political powers are already striving to implement the same policies that led to this disaster based on environmental destruction and the extension of economic globalization. It’s like seeing someone who, just as he begins to recover a little bit from a heart attack, begins to plan on returning with redoubled strength to the way of life that led him to that situation.\\n\\nAnyhow, We would be deceived if we thought that what we are living is a parenthesis, a punctual pause -more or less long and deep- in the normality. Nothing will be ever the same than before. The collapse of our system will produce other shocking situations. To cite one example among many, we are likely to experience increasingly long periods of supply of fossil fuels, which will lead to a cascade of socio-economic impacts, starting with the short-circuit of human transport and, Which is more relevant, goods. Something that may still seem distant is becoming more and more likely. Crude oil prices on the ground are leading to the bankruptcy of US fracking companies, but in general they are a problem of the sector, which sees its profitability diminishing. This results in the reduction in investments, which is already underway. The result is that the lower availability of crude oil is reinforced. In such a situation, a massive restriction of mobility can be understood as logical by the population and this restriction is not only personal, but also implies a commitment to more local production and consumption. Much more local than that. Again, something that is difficult to put forward today at the political level, but much less than before the pandemic, can be made feasible.\\n\\nIn the face of that fear, our responsibility is to convey hope, for only another emotion can help to overcome it. I say it’s a responsibility because I think we have to do it, even if it weakens us. If we who fight for a just, democratic and sustainable world do not do so, no one will realize it, and without hope there is no emancipatory process of change that can succeed. Other social sectors will use this fear to maintain their positions of power by fomenting confrontations among the popular classes.\\n\\nI don’t mean a hope in magic solutions, or in the return to the previous normal. That’s impossible. I am referring to the hope that the collapse of this social and economic order may offer us opportunities to build societies where life is worth living. A hope centered on a lucid thought.\\n\\nThe emotional burden of making the least bad decisions is very heavy. In normal times, we can afford a way to be flaccid. Let us be carried away by collective and individual automatisms. In times like these we are living in, we have a vital and ethical obligation to grow in the challenges we face in our personal lives and in our political choices.\",\n",

You can seriously make a huge impact beyond your wildest dreams and do so CONVENIENTLY and with little or no discernible change in your habits. Remember though, you need to get your message and support to the producers.\\n\\nBrazil produces nearly 60MM bags of coffee annually, which is around 40% of all the coffee produced in the world. This includes varieties of Arabica and Robusta, high end and low end, and everything in-between. Though single origin, small estate coffees from Brazil are there, they are not all the rage in the specialty market. Instead, coffees for specialty blends (like for your local roasters espresso blend for example) and commercial blends (think your Folgers and Tim Hortons) are the primary movers and shakers. There are exceptions, but we're talking 1-2% of the Brazilian coffee market is the top stuff. The rest is commercial or for blends.\\n\\nThe sway Brazil has over coffee is so drastic, that reports of bad or good weather can affect the entire futures markets for coffee sold on in NY (the ICE or C Future for Arabica) and in London (for Robusta prices). So who to look to?\\n\\nBig Players\\n\\n* JAB Holdings, Nestle (yeah...they won't give a shit will they), Starbucks, and Lavazza are the dominant forces who control a substantial chunk of the green coffee importing business. Call your MPS and demand some action here, as these big folks are only going to bend to policy changes, sanctions (we use them to punish rogue states, why not rogue environmental states?), etc.\\n\\nMid Level Players\\n\\n* Green Coffee Sellers. They sell to roasters. In the US (for whom I can speak to) are Olam, Cafe Imports, Ally Coffee (mainly Brazils), InterAmerican, Atlas, and some other small folks. Our folks who roast their own might recognize both Mr. Green Bean and Sweet Marias. CALL THEM. Tell them you will not purchase Brazilian coffee and ask for substitutes.\\n* The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) and other trade organizations. The SCA includes many guilds like the Roaster's Guild, Barista's Guild of America, etc, and spans the globe. Contact them. Express outrage. If you are going to an SCA event or a World Barista Championship...SPEAK OUT!\\n\\nLow-Level Players\\n\\n* Your local coffee shop and roaster. Don't just avoid Brazilian coffee, ask what the single origin is and get it. Your mind will likely be blown by what espresso is available or that regional offering rather than the standard breakfast blend. Tell the barista/roaster/owner WHY you don't want Brazil. Encourage them to get involved.\\n\\nWhy could this be stupid easy and result in absolutely no inconvenience to you, the busy consumer? There is a crap ton of amazing and well-priced coffees out there that blow Brazilian coffee out of the water. El Salvador? Yep. Guatemala? Sure. Some really nice stuff coming out of Peru these days and Honduras?

They are if you  look at the cumulative emissions in the period 1988 - 2015. However, in  2015 the 224 most emitting companies where responsible for 72 % GHG  emissions. 100 or 224 companies, I guess that is not really the point.\\n\\nWhat  type of companies are these? All are fossil fuel producers. So, they  are not really making your products, except most of the energy we use.  So, if you have a car, use electricity or buy ANYTHING, good luck  boycotting.\\n\\nAre these companies  really doing the emissions? Well yes, about 10 % of it. The remaining 90  % is downstream emissions. So if Shell or BP drills up oil and someone  uses the oil in their car the emissions will be attributed to Shell, and  not the driver.\\n\\nIs this 71 % of  ALL anthropogenic emissions? No, this excludes non-industrial sources,  mainly land-use, agriculture and forestry. I don\\'t know exactly how this  is accounted, but this excludes about 25 % of GHG emissions. So the  gain from veganism is not in this number. So the real number might be  about 54 % of anthropogenic emissions, but again I don’t know how this  would be accounted. So, in summary 224 companies are directly  responsible for 5.4 % of anthropogenic emissions, or 54 % direct +  indirect.\\n\\nI do not want to make  excuses for these companies, i just want people too to be informed. So,  if people reduce their energy consumption these companies will reduce  their emissions too.\\n\\nSo what can  you do about this list? Not sure. If you have lots of money to invest,  you can use your power. Many people have lots of money in their  retirement savings, I think this is where people have the most direct  power. Reducing your energy use will also work. But this list is best  utilised by investors.\\n\\nIf I have misunderstood anything, please let me know.  \\n(i have posted this elsewhere)',\n",

Some of these are expensive to do, some of them are easy to do no matter what your income is.\\n\\n\\n*Easy stuff:*\\n\\n\\n**Turn off your outdoor house lights at night.** Google 'Dark Sky movement' to understand why. Basically a lot of insects and life depend on their natural circadian rhythm. Let's stop messing around with that.\\n\\n**If you have a cat as a pet, keep it indoors.** Cats are an invasive species and hunt down whatever they can get...especially song birds. There's a lot of sing birds that have declining numbers and cats contribute to this. Keep your cats inside.\\n\\n**Don't purchase useless products.** \\nThink of that show with Marie Kondo and purchase/keep stuff that you give some real thought about; if you deduce that product as improving your life, then great! If not, don't bother. Buy used stuff where possible.\\n\\n**Inform your local municipalities to adopt new by-laws.** \\nPropose new regulations/bylaws for tree cutting. Inform your municipalities to bring in cat control bylaws similar to existing dog control bylaws.\\n\\n**Recommend your state or provincial government of new regulation.**\\nPropose to regulate and ban the selling of invasive and non-native vegetation at nurseries and landscape companies. Propose the banning of pesticides. Propose tax credits to home-owners and farmers to plant native plants/trees.\\n\\n**Tell your non-right leaning friends and family to watch the documentary.**\\nDo not waste your time and effort trying to convince hard right-leaning family members. It's crushing to attempt it...I hate to generalize but red-necks and boomers are pretty stubborn and have lived comfortable lives. They don't want to change that. Educate people who are already more progressive or even centrist. They are usually more open-minded and intelligent.\\n\\n\\n*Medium Level stuff:*\\n\\n\\n**Minimize eating meat.** \\nYou don't have to stop eating meat, but try eating meat once a week or so...make the change gradually and its hardly noticeable.\\n\\n**Buy food from local markets and buy organic where possible.** \\nWe need to stop supporting pesticide based agriculture.\\n\\n**Do your research on native plant species in your area and plant them on your property**\\nDo your research on identifying invasive species and remove them when you see them. Plant native (to your area) plant species on your property instead.\\n\\n\\n*Difficult/Costly stuff:*\\n\\n\\n**Get rid of the gas powered utilities in your house:**\\n\\n* Replace your gas stove with induction or electric (induction is best, but expensive). \\n* Replace your gas furnace with electric air handler plus replace your A/C with a heat pump. Heat Pump + Air handler is a very efficient combination. Slightly more costly up-front.\\n* Replace your gas dryer with an electric dryer. We actually hang our clothes in our basement over the winter. We do not have a dryer at all.\\n\\n\\n**Replace your aging or high mileage car with an electric car** \\nThis should be your main savings priority even above the house stuff - petroleum based energy is worse than natural gas.\\n\\n**Replace your shingles with solar shingles or add panels**\\nTesla's solar shingles still haven't yet ramped up to full production but it will probably happen in the next few years.\\n\\n**Consider having less or no kids** \\nI put this one here as some people find this a touchy subject. Was an easy decision for us though.\\n\\n**Donate money to local, state, provincial charities that support the environment and conservation of natural areas.** \\nWe donate to a Provincial nature charity and National charity that actually does lobbying too, which is awesome. We also donate to progressive political parties and Land Trusts (Land Trusts are usually run by environmental experts/hobbyists and they actively purchase existing natural land or farmland and re-naturalize it. Land Trusts are amazing and I get teary-eyed just thinking about how awesome our local one is).\\n\\n**Minimize air travel.**\\nI put this here as some people find big vacations as a mandatory lifestyle choice. It is a choice after all, so choose to do less international travel (COVID making this easy). Travel by train or car to places within your own country that you would love to visit. For now try to stay home, due to COVID though! Also, minimizing air travel will save you quite a bit of money that you can put towards electrifying your house or purchasing an electric car.\",\n",

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.\\n\\n“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.”\\n\\nThe scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.\\n“There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.”\\nThe signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.\\n\\n“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,” they note. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”\\n“If better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt.

Ark itself has Mrs Wood at the helm so win for their G but also recently took a huge position in Palantir who have admitted to their platform being used to kill people so knock on the S; they also have a position in Draft Kings- how do you feel about gambling and/or Dave Potnoy. From an E stand point their biggest win was their early bet on Tesla and they have other evehicles which help to wash their environmental standards.  \\nWhich brings me to point two, using Tesla as the example. The companies they are investing in may have a good ESG standing but that is not WHY they invest. Also, while TSLA has a great E, his Technoking-ness is far from woke on the S & G elements (unsafe working conditions, forcing workers back to work where they contracted covid so he could hit is bonus,  his brother is a mainstay of the board,  etc.)\\nThis is where it comes down to what you want from your acronym. If you simply want to avoid serious carbon assets then disruptive tech by its current nature does pretty well. (Which incidentally is how a lot of these ESG funds do so well,  high percentage allocation to tech like FB, Microsoft, Tesla, etc because of thier \"low carbon footprint\" you know, because they are tech stocks...) However if you are looking for a more well rounded ESG or companies/investment firms that are actively pursuing ESG initiatives to better humanity, bring equality to the board room,  have social justice initiatives,  name your series of factors then Ark is not for you. \\nThe question is are you good simply because you are not bad or is being good an active pursuit?',\n",
